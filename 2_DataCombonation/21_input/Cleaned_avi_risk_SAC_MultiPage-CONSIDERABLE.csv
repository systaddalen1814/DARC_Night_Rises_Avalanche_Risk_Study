0,15,February,2025,"Yesterday, people unintentionally triggered several large avalanches that failed several feet below the snow surface and broke much wider than expected. Triggering similar avalanches remains likely today in all elevation zones, even in sheltered below treeline terrain, which people often consider safe. Opting for lower-angle, low-consequence terrain can help reduce the chances of getting caught in a large avalanche today.",SAC
1,7,February,2025,"Dangerous avalanche conditions exist today. Large avalanches are likely in areas where wind-blown snow has filled in slopes near ridges, gullies, and open areas. Large avalanches that fail on weak snow several feet below the surface could also occur on sheltered slopes in some areas. Opting for lower angle, low consequence terrain is a good idea for today.",SAC
2,6,February,2025,A powerful storm will bring heavy snow and strong winds to our forecast region today forming slabs of wind blown snow.  Heavy loading of the snowpack with this storm will make larger avalanches possible that break deeper in the snowpack.  A period of HIGH avalanche danger is expected to occur this evening and overnight during high intensity snowfall.  Dangerous avalanche conditions will exist today as this storm impacts our region.,SAC
3,5,February,2025,"New snow and strong winds will form slabs of wind blown snow along ridges, in gully features, and in open areas.  Areas of loose snow may slide downhill on steeper slopes.  Dangerous avalanche conditions could exist today with large avalanches in the backcountry, avoid steep avalanche terrain where these problems exist.",SAC
4,3,February,2025,"You could trigger a wide propagating avalanche today in a variety of terrain. This includes the possibility of triggering an avalanche from low on the slope in wind protected terrain below treeline. Opting for lower angle, low consequence terrain is a good idea for today.",SAC
5,3,January,2025,"A quick but potent storm is expected today, leading to a rapid increase in avalanche danger this afternoon. High intensity snowfall and gale force winds are expected to create areas of unstable snow, especially near ridgetops, gullies, and on open slopes that are rapidly filled in with wind drifted snow. A transition from stable conditions to avalanches occurring may happen over a short period of time today.",SAC
6,29,December,2024,"Another wet storm will enter our area with high elevation snow, rain, and strong winds.  Slabs of wind blown snow will form in gully features, below ridges, and in open terrain.  Sloughs of new snow could slide downhill on existing firm snow surfaces.  Dangerous avalanche conditions will exist today as more snow and wind impact our forecast region.",SAC
7,24,December,2024,"New snow and wind will make avalanches more likely today, especially near ridges, in gullies, and on windy slopes where wind-blown snow accumulates. Avalanches may also be possible on steep, sheltered slopes where the new snow piles up too fast. It will take constant effort to carefully reassess the snow and terrain as you travel in today's rapidly changing conditions. ",SAC
8,16,December,2024,Many avalanches have occurred in the last 48 hours in our forecast region.  The recent storm snow overlies previous weak sugary surface snow that has led to large avalanches occurring.  Strong winds will continue to create slabs of wind blown snow in open areas.  Active loading of new snow and wind will occur today with avalanches remaining likely.,SAC
9,15,December,2024,A strong storm cycle deposited heavy dense snow with strong winds and left us with multiple avalanche problems.  This new storm snow now exists over previous weak surface snow.  Strong winds have created slabs of wind blown snow in exposed areas.  Dangerous avalanche conditions could exist today with large and destructive avalanches occurring.,SAC
10,13,December,2024,"There are numerous possibilities for avalanches today, both large and small. The areas of greatest avalanche danger exist in locations that received 8 or more inches of new snowfall over the past 24 hours. In some areas, this new snow was deposited on top of a weak old snow surface that could lead to complicated and dangerous avalanche problems. HIGH avalanche danger is expected for Saturday.",SAC
11,12,December,2024,A rapid increase in avalanche danger is expected this morning. The greatest avalanche danger will occur in areas that receive 6 or more inches of new snowfall today. This new snow is depositing on top of a weak old snow surface that could lead to complicated and dangerous avalanche problems.,SAC
12,26,November,2024,"Our current storm continues today with more heavy wet snow and strong winds.  In areas that have weak sugary snow near the base of the  snowpack, this heavy snow will add additional load with the potential for large avalanches.  Strong winds will continue to form slabs of wind blown snow in open areas.  Dangerous avalanche conditions could exist today.  ",SAC
13,23,November,2024,"A heavy load of rain and new snow was added to the snowpack last night. You could trigger an avalanche easily large enough to bury a person today in a variety of areas, including below treeline. Take a cautious approach to travel near avalanche terrain today, anticipating an increased likelihood of triggering an avalanche.",SAC
