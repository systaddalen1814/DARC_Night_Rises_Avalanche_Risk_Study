12,31,2024,"a special avalanche advisory is in effect from 4:30 pm monday until 5 pm wednesday. avalanche conditions are dangerous. you can easily trigger avalanches large enough to injure or kill you. backcountry travelers triggered many avalanches from a distance or the bottom of steep slopes in the last few days. safe travel will require giving most slopes steeper than around 30 degrees wide buffers. be aware of steep terrain above you, even if you are in gentle or flat terrain. slopes where wind-drifting is occurring will be even more dangerous. this could occur in cross-loaded features, so avoid slopes below cornices and with obvious pillows of wind-drifted snow.",caic
12,29,2024,"An Avalanche Watch is in effect for the Summit County mountains and the Front Range. Very dangerous avalanche conditions develop overnight on Sunday, lasting through Monday. Strong winds and heavy snow will result in long-running natural avalanches and easy-to-trigger, large, dangerous avalanches. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended on Monday.On Sunday, backcountry travelers can easily trigger avalanches where the winds have drifted snow into thick slabs. Avalanches can also be triggered from the flats below steep slopes or adjacent low-angle slopes. Give wind-loaded slopes a wide berth. Slopes with recently wind-drifted snow are the most dangerous. Shooting cracks and audible collapses are obvious indications to avoid steep slopes.

12,28,2024,"backcountry travelers can  easily trigger avalanches on steep slopes. slopes with recently wind-drifted snow are the most dangerous. the strong winds may form drifts farther below ridgelines than you expect. they may be wrapped around terrain features in unusual ways. you will find drifted snow on some open slopes below treeline, too. drifts may be smooth, pillow-like, show textured scallops, or feel chalky and hard. shooting cracks and audible collapses are obvious indications to avoid steep slopes. choose wind-sheltered slopes or ones less than 30 degrees in steepness.",caic
12,27,2024,"you can easily trigger an avalanche on drifted slopes that face north through east to southeast at upper elevations. steep, drifted slopes below ridgelines are the most dangerous areas. you can recognize drifted slopes by their smooth, pillow-like appearance and fresh cornice development. if you trigger a slide in recently drifted snow it can easily step down and grow larger and more dangerous. if you notice obvious signs of instability like shooting cracks and audible collapses, then move to slopes sheltered from the wind or less than about 30 degrees.",caic
