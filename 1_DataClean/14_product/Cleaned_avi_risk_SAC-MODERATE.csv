January 8, 2021 at 6:58 In most areas, triggering an avalanche is becoming more difficult. Some exceptions include areas with a shallow snowpack where old weak snow remains closer to the surface or places where new snow and wind may form small slabs of drifted snow today especially in the northern part of the forecast area. In these places, human-triggered avalanches may remain possible. The avalanche danger remains MODERATE at all elevations. 
",SAC
6,January,2021,"
January 6, 2021 at 6:59 Persistent slab and wind slab avalanche problems remain possible today.  MODERATE avalanche danger will exist at all elevations.  Unstable snow continues to exist in some areas of the forecast region.
",SAC
3,January,2021,"
January 3, 2021 at 6:57 The likelihood of triggering an avalanche has gradually decreased but the consequences have not. Isolated areas of unstable snow linger due to a persistent slab avalanche problem. Any isolated avalanches today are likely to be larger than expected. MODERATE avalanche danger lingers at all elevations. Increasing avalanche danger is expected tomorrow.
",SAC
2,January,2021,"
January 2, 2021 at 6:58 Triggering an avalanche on steep slopes still remains possible today especially in places with a shallower snowpack and old weak snow below the surface. Some fragile slabs of wind drifted snow may also exist in wind-affected terrain. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Conservative terrain choices are recommended when traveling in the backcountry.
",SAC
31,December,2020,"
December 31, 2020 at 6:59 Triggering avalanche on steep slopes still remains possible especially in wind affected terrain where new slabs of wind drifted snow exist or in more sheltered terrain where the old snow below the surface remains weak. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Conservative terrain choices are recommended when traveling in the backcountry. This forecast will be updated on Jan. 2 by 7 am. 
",SAC
30,December,2020,"
December 30, 2020 at 6:59 Persistent slab and wind slab avalanche problems continue for our area.  It remains possible to trigger a large avalanche in our forecast region due to our poor snowpack structure.  MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations.  Conservative terrain choices are recommended when traveling in the backcountry.
",SAC
22,December,2020,"
December 22, 2020 at 6:53 MODERATE avalanche danger continues for our area.  A persistent slab avalanche problem remains a concern in below and near treeline areas.  Increased winds overnight will make unstable wind slabs in near and above treeline terrain.  Human triggered avalanches remain possible today.  
",SAC
21,December,2020,"
December 21, 2020 at 6:55 Spatial variability for the persistent slab avalanche problem is increasing. This makes it more difficult to observe evidence of instability prior to triggering a persistent slab avalanche. Triggering a large avalanche remains possible, especially near treeline and below treeline. Additionally, small unstable slabs of wind drifted snow (wind slabs) exist above treeline and near treeline. MODERATE avalanche danger continues at all elevations.
",SAC
20,December,2020,"
December 20, 2020 at 6:55 Unstable conditions are persisting, longer than what often occurs in this region. Trigging a large avalanche remains possible, especially near treeline and below treeline. Additionally, small unstable slabs of wind drifted snow may exist above treeline and near treeline. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. This is not the time to try and outsmart the snowpack. Stick with mellow terrain for now, waiting patiently for the right set of conditions to move into bigger, steeper terrain at another time.
",SAC
19,December,2020,"
December 19, 2020 at 6:59 Within the snowpack, lurks old weak sugary snow that can barely support the soft slabs of recent snow. People recreating on steep slopes where this weak snow exists could break this layer possibly triggering large avalanches. This problem is widespread near and below treeline and isolated above treeline. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Traveling on slopes less steep than 30 degrees that are not connected to steeper slopes can provide fun snow and better safety margins.
",SAC
18,December,2020,"
December 18, 2020 at 7:00 Today's biggest concerns exist on steep slopes where old weak sugary snow barely supports the soft slabs of recent snow above it. People could tip the balance and break this layer possibly triggering avalanches. This problem is widespread near and below treeline and isolated above treeline. Shifting winds have also moved slabs of drifted snow into new places at upper elevations. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. More accidents happen at MODERATE and CONSIDERABLE than any other danger ratings.
",SAC
13,December,2020,"
December 13, 2020 at 7:00 Avalanche danger will rapidly increase from midday onwards. Isolated and still unstable slabs of wind drifted snow from yesterday (wind slabs) will be a problem this morning and added to this afternoon with increasing size and distribution. A persistent slab avalanche problem is expected to develop during today's storm. Avalanche danger will increase from MODERATE danger this morning to CONSIDERABLE this afternoon. HIGH avalanche danger is possible tonight if the upper end of the forecast snowfall amount is reached.
",SAC
12,December,2020,"
December 12, 2020 at 7:00 The new snow has made the rocks and other obstacles harder to see and easier to hit. This storm's new snow and wind have also added potential avalanche concerns. Unstable slabs of wind drifted snow (wind slabs) may exist on open slopes near ridgelines on almost any aspect today. Human triggered avalanches will be possible. MODERATE avalanche danger exists in near and above treeline terrain. 
",SAC

",SAC
20,April,2020,"
April 20, 2020 at 6:57 Sunshine this morning and rain showers this afternoon should provide enough warming for avalanches of loose wet snow to become possible on mid to low elevation slopes again today. At upper elevations where this afternoon's precipitation falls as snow, loose wet avalanches may remain unlikely. Slabs of wet snow may also still warrant concern in some areas. The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE at mid to low elevations and should remain LOW at upper elevations today. 
",SAC
19,April,2020,"
April 19, 2020 at 7:00 Spring weather with some sunshine should provide enough warming for avalanches of loose wet snow to become possible on steep slopes again today. Slabs of wet snow may also still warrant concern in some areas. The avalanche danger is MODERATE today.
