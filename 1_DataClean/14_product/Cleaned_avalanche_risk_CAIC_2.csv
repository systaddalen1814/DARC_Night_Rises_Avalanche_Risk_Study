12,26,2024,"You can trigger an avalanche on drifted slopes that face north through east to southeast. Steep, drifted slopes below ridgelines are the most dangerous areas. You can recognize drifted slopes by their smooth, pillow-like appearance. Avoid these areas and seek out wind-sheltered slopes as a safer option.You probably won't notice obvious signs of instability like shooting cracks and audible collapses until the storm intensifies. These signs are an indication that conditions are becoming more dangerous. Areas with more than about eight inches of new snow are more dangerous.

12,25,2024,"Light winds and a few inches of snow aren't enough to increase the danger. You can trigger an avalanche in drifted snow below steep ridgelines and convex rollovers. Look out for problematic drifts on alpine slopes that face northeast through east to southeast. Intense winds drifted snow into dense slabs on some slopes but completely scoured others. Right now, many of the most enticing places to ride are where you find problematic drifts. Hollow-sounding snow or cracking in the snow are signs to avoid steep slopes. Although, you probably won't see any warning signs before you trigger an avalanche.On shady and sheltered slopes at lower elevations, the snow is cohesionless and can sluff off of very steep slopes. These can be dangerous if you're above a gully or cliff.

12,24,2024,"You can trigger avalanches below ridgelines and near convex rollovers. This is particularly true for slopes that face northeast through east to southeast. Winds drifted snow into firm slabs on these aspects. Look for and avoid rounded pillows of hollow-feeling snow. You will probably not see any warning signs before you trigger an avalanche.You may be able to trigger loose avalanches made up of weak faceted grains in steep north-facing areas. You can identify these spots because the snowpack is cohesionless from top to bottom.

12,22,2024,you can trigger an avalanche where winds have drifted snow into firm slabs. look for and avoid rounded pillows of hollow-feeling snow. most avalanches have been reported on slopes that face east in the alpine. below ridgelines and in cross-loaded gullies are the places you will find this problem. cracking or collapsing in the snowpack is unlikely before you trigger an avalanche. the avalanche you trigger will break on weak snow and may be more significant than the terrain feature you are on. you can find safer riding on slopes sheltered from the wind with soft snow at the surface.,caic
12,20,2024,"you are most likely to trigger an avalanche on a northeast, east, or southeast-facing slope that was recently drifted. be careful on large, steep open slopes directly below ridgetop and consider sticking to more sheltered terrain. avalanches in drifted snow can grow large as they gouge into older snow layers.",caic
12,19,2024,"you can trigger an avalanche where intense winds built thick slabs of cohesive snow on top of a layer of weak snow one to two feet below the surface. upper-elevation east and southeast-facing slopes are the most dangerous but cross-loaded slopes that face north and northeast are also suspect. as slabs thicken and connect, you may be able to trigger an avalanche from a distance and below. slides can easily step down into weak snow closer to the ground and grow larger as well. look for and avoid pillows of firm snow in steep terrain, especially just below ridgelines. you can find safer riding on low-angle or wind-sheltered slopes.",caic
