2,4,2025,"Slopes with recently drifted snow are the most hazardous. Avalanches in recently drifted snow can step down to the ground and grow even larger. You will find these areas below ridgelines and along gullies. Shallow slopes with exposed rocks and trees are the most likely place to find a weak area and trigger a deeper avalanche. You will not get any warning signs, and multiple people could ride a slope before you find a weak area. You can find safer riding on slopes protected from the wind and slopes less than about 30 degrees.Above-freezing temperatures tomorrow will likely cause the snow to become wet and sluff off steep, sunny slopes. Avalanches could gouge deeper into the snowpack and grow larger as they run. If you sink to your ankles in wet, gloppy snow or see rollerballs, avoid being on, or below, steep slopes.

1,30,2025,"Avoid recently wind-drifted slopes to reduce your risk of avalanches. Recently drifted snow sits on shallowly buried weak layers. You can trigger an avalanche about a foot deep on this layer that then gouges deeper into the snowpack, resulting in a more destructive avalanche.
