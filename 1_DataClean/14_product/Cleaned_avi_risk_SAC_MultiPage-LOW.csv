24,January,2025,"While getting caught in an avalanche remains unlikely today, the icy conditions on many near and above treeline slopes make sliding falls or runaway equipment/snowmobiles possible. Shady slopes below treeline still hold some areas of softer snow. Talk with your group to make plans that match your skills to the current conditions and continue using best-practice backcountry travel techniques.",SAC
23,January,2025,"Sunny skies will continue with cool winds that will limit snow surface softening again today.  Variable and firm snow surfaces exist in many areas throughout the forecast region.  Avalanches remain unlikely, normal caution is advised.",SAC
22,January,2025,"Sunny weather will continue today with increased winds at higher elevations.  Minor wet snow formation will become possible as daytime warming occurs.  Avalanches continue to remain unlikely throughout the forecast region, normal caution is advised.",SAC
21,January,2025,"Sunny and warmer conditions are forecasted for today.  Wet snow is expected to form on sun exposed slopes as daytime warming occurs with limited impacts to backcountry users.  Avalanches remain unlikely today, normal caution is advised. ",SAC
20,January,2025,"Avalanches remain unlikely on a regional scale. Firm snow surface conditions exist on most open slopes, especially near ridgetops. Sliding falls or runaway equipment/snowmobiles are possible near treeline and above treeline. Softer snow surface conditions exist on shaded slopes well below treeline.",SAC

16,January,2025,"Sunny and warmer weather is expected today throughout the forecast region.  Avalanches remain unlikely, with LOW avalanche danger continuing.  Use normal caution if traveling in the backcountry.",SAC
15,January,2025,"Problematic avalanches remain unlikely on a regional scale. Still, warmer sunny weather could create some shallow wet snow that might slide down isolated steep sunny slopes today. Continue to use best-practice backcountry travel techniques, such as only exposing one person at a time to steep slopes and assessing the snow and terrain as you travel. ",SAC
14,January,2025,"Problematic avalanches are unlikely on a regional scale. Keep an eye out for small, isolated areas of unstable snow. These could take the form of either shallow slabs of wind drifted snow near ridgetops or surface wet snow on wind protected slopes with direct sun exposure.",SAC
13,January,2025,Winds will increase today with blowing snow in wind exposed areas.  Small slabs of wind blown snow could form in isolated locations.  Avalanches remain unlikely throughout the forecast region.,SAC
12,January,2025,Strong winds will continue today with the potential for blowing snow.  Small slabs of wind drifted snow could form in isolated areas throughout the forecast region.  Avalanche danger remains LOW today with avalanches unlikely.,SAC
11,January,2025,"NE winds are on the increase today, with some areas of blowing and drifting snow expected. Stiff, shallow slabs of wind drifted snow may form in isolated areas. In the big picture, avalanches remain unlikely on a regional scale.",SAC
10,January,2025,"Stiff slabs of wind drifted snow may remain unstable in isolated areas. Locations in or adjacent to chutes, couloirs, cliff bands, or other forms of complex terrain have the greatest potential to hold isolated areas of unstable snow. In the big picture, avalanches are unlikely on a regional scale.",SAC
9,January,2025,"Isolated areas of unstable snow may linger in places that were recently filled in with wind drifted snow. Locations in or adjacent to chutes, couloirs, cliff bands, or other forms of complex terrain have the greatest potential to hold isolated areas of unstable snow. In the big picture, avalanches are unlikely on a regional scale.",SAC
1,January,2025,"Avalanche activity has become unlikely for most of the forecast area. Still, triggering an avalanche may not be impossible on an isolated terrain feature in extreme terrain filled in with wind-blown snow. Continue to use best-practice backcountry travel techniques, such as only exposing one person at a time to steep slopes and assessing the snow and terrain as you travel.
The next update to the avalanche forecast will occur on Jan 2, 2025 @ 7:00 am.",SAC
31,December,2024,"Avalanche activity has become unlikely for most of the forecast area. Still, triggering an avalanche may not be impossible on an isolated terrain feature in extreme terrain where wind-blown snow has piled up.

23,December,2024,"Today will be a break in storm activity with mild weather conditions.  Avalanches will remain unlikely, use normal caution if traveling in the backcountry today.  Avalanche danger is expected to increase tomorrow as a stronger storm enters our forecast region.",SAC
22,December,2024,"Light rain and high elevation snow is expected for our forecast area today.  These weather conditions should have limited change on avalanche activity.  Avalanches are unlikely, normal caution is advised if traveling in the backcountry today.  ",SAC
11,December,2024,"Avalanches remain unlikely today, but the avalanche danger will increase tonight and tomorrow as a storm hits the area.
Keep practicing good travel techniques, such as carrying avalanche safety gear, only exposing one person at a time when traveling in steep terrain, and regrouping in safe zones. Expect variable snow conditions and plenty of obstacles when traveling in the backcountry today. ",SAC
10,December,2024,"Significant avalanche activity remains unlikely, but it is worth watching for isolated areas of wind-drifted snow that may have formed near ridges during the night.  Keep practicing good travel techniques like carrying avalanche safety gear, only exposing one person at a time when traveling in steep terrain, and regrouping in safe zones. Expect variable snow conditions and plenty of obstacles when traveling in the backcountry. ",SAC
9,December,2024,LOW avalanche danger continues with avalanche activity unlikely.  Early season snowpack conditions prevail throughout the forecast region with a shallow snowpack and many obstacles present.  Use normal caution while traveling in the backcountry.,SAC
8,December,2024,Early season conditions exist with a shallow snowpack and variable snow surface conditions present.  Avalanche activity remains unlikely at this point.  Use normal caution if traveling in the backcountry today.,SAC
7,December,2024,"Avalanche activity remains unlikely at this time. Best practice, normal caution techniques for travel in backcountry avalanche terrain are advised.  Expect variable snow surface conditions and plenty of opportunities to encounter obstacles in the shallow snowpack.",SAC
6,December,2024,"Avalanche activity remains unlikely at this time. Best practice, normal caution techniques for travel in backcountry avalanche terrain are advised.  Expect variable snow surface conditions and plenty of opportunities to encounter obstacles in the shallow snowpack.",SAC

4,December,2024,"Avalanche activity has grown unlikely, but people should still practice good travel techniques like carrying avalanche safety gear, only exposing one person at a time when traveling in steep terrain, and regrouping in safe zones. Expect variable snow conditions and plenty of obstacles when traveling in the backcountry. Talk with your group to make plans that match your skills with the current conditions. ",SAC
3,December,2024,"Avalanche activity has grown unlikely, but some weak snow still lingers at the base of the snowpack on high-elevation, shady slopes. Talk with your group to make plans that match your skills with the current conditions. Carry avalanche safety gear, only expose one person at a time when traveling in steep terrain, and regroup in safe zones. ",SAC
2,December,2024,"Mild sunny weather with light winds will continue.  A weak snowpack structure continues to be present in some isolated portions of the forecast region.  LOW avalanche danger exists with avalanches unlikely today, normal caution is advised.",SAC
1,December,2024,Snowpack coverage varies based on elevation and location.  Unstable snow and weak snowpack structure continue in isolated areas of the forecast region.  LOW avalanche danger exists with avalanches unlikely today.  ,SAC
30,November,2024,"There remains a small chance you might trigger an isolated, but sizable avalanche due to lingering poor snowpack structure. Not all LOW avalanche danger days are equal. Moving through avalanche terrain while acknowledging uncertainty and maintaining preparedness for a large and unexpected avalanche is the current theme.",SAC
