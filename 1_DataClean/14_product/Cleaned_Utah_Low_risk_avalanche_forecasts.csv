4,10,2024,"The snowpack is generally stable, and the avalanche danger is overall LOW this morning, with normal caution advised. The two main concerns are isolated pockets of wind-drifted snow in exposed upper-elevation terrain and wet snow on the steep solar slopes.

Most of the drifting will be on north to east to south facing aspects, but terrain channeling may drift snow onto any aspect. These soft slabs should be easy to recognize this morning; avoid any slopes with obvious signs of wind-drifted snow.

Throughout the day, as the winds decrease, the strong sunshine may cause the avalanche danger to rise at all elevations facing east-south-west. In these areas, it could become possible for humans to trigger wet loose snow avalanches.",Ogden
3,23,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW and the snow is generally stable.  Remember that Low danger does not mean No danger.  Even small avalanches can lead to trouble in extreme terrain.  

With a strong storm heading our way, be sure to re-evaluate your plans based on the weather today. Heavy snowfall for a short period can instantly spike the avalanche danger.",Ogden
3,22,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW and the snow is generally stable.  Remember that Low danger does not mean No danger.  Even small avalanches can lead to trouble in extreme terrain.

I don't think we'll see enough new snowfall (3-5"") today to pose an problem, but if we see more snow and wind than expected, watch for increasing danger in the new snow in the steeper terrain on all aspects of the higher elevations. Continue to give the yawning cornices a wide berth.",Ogden

Deadly slab avalanches may fail in a persistent weak layer and be up to 6' deep on upper and mid-elevation slopes facing west through north and southeast. On all other slopes, the main concern is soft slabs of storm snow or wind-drifted snow 2-3' deep. In areas without a cohesive slab, you may trigger long-running loose snow sluffs in steep terrain.
With the sun, the solar aspects may experience pinwheels, roller balls, and small sluffs as the cold snow heats up.

1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow.

Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to.

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to.",Ogden

1,6,2016,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE.  Human triggered avalanches are possible from recent wind loads and or deep weak layers failing in shallow snowpack areas.  Accurate snowpack analysis and terrain selection are crucial.  The avalanche danger is less pronounced in the mid and lower elevations.,Ogden
12,13,2016,"Avalanche conditions are still very complicated in the Ogden Mountains.  There is a possibility of human triggered avalanches today; mainly in upper-elevation wind drifted terrain.  These avalanches, with the help of our persistent weak layer could break to the ground.  The chances of that are slim, but if you were to find the sweet spot large un-survivable avalanches could be triggered.  More than likely these wind slabs will fail on NSF (Near Surface Facets) that formed prior to last weekends storm.  Skiing the South side of the compass is usually a safe bet but with current conditions these slopes are just as dangerous as the North.  
With more snow coming this weekend get familiar with the snow surface in the Ogden Mtns.  There is still great riding conditions on low angle sheltered terrain, why push it when more cold snow is on the way this weekend.  If you need to push the limits and ski the steep and deep head to one of our world class resorts!

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to. 
Lastly - Glide Avalanches. These are an isolated issue and usually occur in areas where the snow rest on smooth rock slabs. The release of a glide avalanche is unpredictable, but it is usually preceded by the opening of a visible glide crack. The main way to avoid these slides is simply avoid being under slopes with a large glide crack.",SLA

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to.",SLA
