January,13,2024,"THE AVALANCHE DANGER IS HIGH, AND TRAVELING IN AVALANCHE TERRAIN IS NOT RECOMMENDED. DEADLY AND DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS EXIST ACROSS ALL ASPECTS AND ELEVATIONS. 

Later this afternoon, the avalanche danger will likely rise to EXTREME as we expect another storm that will usher in warming temperatures, strong winds, and heavy wet snowfall.",Ogden
February,16,2021,"DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS WILL EXIST FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 


Today the avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and upper elevations. The danger may rise to EXTREME in some areas within the next day. The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at low elevations. Avoid all avalanche terrain and avoid being under or near any steep slope. Even very small slopes can bury a person.
Heavy snowfall, strong westerly winds, and a weak faceted snowpack have created very dangerous avalanche conditions. Natural and human triggered avalanches are very likely. Even unusual avalanches are possible in atypical terrain on atypical aspects and elevations.  

Anybody going into or near the mountains today should avoid being near or under any steep slope - this includes skiing, snowshoeing, running, sledding, dog walking, etc.",Ogden
February,15,2021,"DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS WILL EXIST FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 

Heavy snowfall and increasing winds have overloaded our weak faceted snow and created a HIGH avalanche danger. The danger may rise to EXTREME in some areas in the next day or two. Pay attention to changing weather - avalanche danger will increase as this storm intensifies. 
Natural and human triggered avalanches are very likely. Even unusual avalanches are possible in atypical terrain on atypical aspects and elevations.  



What to do? The only viable strategy today is to ride slopes less than 30 degrees in slope steepness, well out from under and not connected to slopes steeper than about 30 degrees.",Ogden

Travel Advice: Avoid being on or beneath steep slopes.",Ogden
February,9,2014,"These are dangerous times.
The danger remains HIGH to EXTREME in many areas of the Wasatch Range.  All aspects and elevations continue to be dangerous. Backcountry travel is not recommended.  Those looking exiting mountain resorts into the ""Sidecountry"" are entering a HIGH to EXTREME danger.  With naturals again likely, you will be in danger even in the flats beneath steep avalanche paths...and it may be possible to pull the avalanche down on top of you.  
We need your help to relay the word that avalanche conditions are HIGH to EXTREME - friends, family, social media - you name it.  Thanks -",Ogden

January,14,2024,"The avalanche danger is EXTREME at all elevations in the backcountry.  Large natural avalanches are certain and ongoing.

People should avoid being in avalanche terrain. Avoid evident and historic avalanche paths and runout zones. Stay off of and out from under all drifted slopes steeper than 30°.",Logan
January,13,2024,"Avalanches are very likely, and the danger is HIGH at all elevations in the backcountry.  Heavy snowfall and strong winds overloaded a widespread buried weak layer, creating very dangerous avalanche conditions. Blizzard conditions will likely cause the danger to rise back up to EXTREME tonight, and very dangerous conditions are likely again tomorrow.

January,12,2024,"Avalanches are very likely, and the danger is HIGH at all elevations in the backcountry.  Heavy snowfall and strong winds overloaded a widespread buried weak layer, creating very dangerous avalanche conditions. Natural avalanches are occurring, and if people venture into avalanche terrain they are likely to trigger long-running, destructive, and life-threatening avalanches.
Blizzard conditions will likely cause the danger to rise to EXTREME today, especially in the Central and Northern Bear River Range.

February,16,2021,"VERY DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS EXIST IN THE BACKCOUNTRY. 
There is HIGH avalanche danger in the backcountry today.  Natural and human triggered avalanches are likely and could be very large, destructive, fast moving, far running, and potentially deadly!  Heavy snowfall and drifting today will cause the danger to increase further,  and EXTREME avalanche danger may develop in some areas later this afternoon or overnight.  Very large and long running natural avalanches are likely to occur.

February,15,2014,"A HIGH or Level 4 avalanche danger exists on many slopes in the in the backcountry, and there's an EXTREME or Level 5 danger in some drifted upper elevation terrain.  Dangerous and destructive avalanches are likely on steep slopes at all elevations and on slopes facing all directions due to continuing mild temperatures, rain, heavy snow, strong southwest wind, and widespread preexisting weak snow.   Several large and long-running natural avalanches occurred in the past two days, and more persistent slab, wet, and wind slab avalanches are likely or ongoing today on steep slopes in the Logan Zone.  Dangerous persistent slab avalanches could be triggered remotely, from a distance, or the flats below steep slopes.    Avoid all travel in avalanche terrain this weekend.  Stay off of and out from under steep slopes and obvious or historic avalanche paths.

February,9,2014,"There is an EXTREME or Level 5 avalanche danger in the backcountry, with continuing heavy snowfall, strong southwest winds, and rising temperatures.   Large natural avalanches are likely and/or ongoing today.  Dangerous deep slab avalanches could be triggered remotely, from a distance, or the flats below steep slopes.

February,8,2014,"There is a HIGH or Level 4 avalanche danger in the backcountry already this morning, and the danger will continue to rise and become more widespread with continuing heavy snowfall, strong southwest winds, and gradually rising temperatures.  Natural and human triggered avalanches are likely. The danger could rise to EXTREME or Level 5 in some drifted terrain this afternoon, with large natural avalanches almost a given overnight.  Dangerous persistent slab avalanches are increasingly likely, and might be triggered remotely, from a distance, or the flats below steep slopes.  Avoid all travel in avalanche terrain.
