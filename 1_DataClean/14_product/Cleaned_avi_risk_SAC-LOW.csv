",SAC
46,10,February,2020,"
February 10, 2020 at 7:00 Firm surfaces, breakable crusts, and continued NE winds will continue to vex backcountry travelers today. Mostly frozen snow surfaces and very little new snow for the wind to blow around should keep significant avalanche activity unlikely today. LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations.
",SAC
47,9,February,2020,"
February 9, 2020 at 6:59 While blowing snow may be present today, significant avalanche activity should remain unlikely since old snow should remain frozen and new snow accumulation should remain limited.
