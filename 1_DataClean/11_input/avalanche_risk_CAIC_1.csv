11/25/2024,"You might find isolated areas of drifted snow and trigger a small avalanche. Look for and avoid drifted pillows of snow on steep slopes at upper elevations, especially just below ridges. Shooting cracks in drifted snow are a clear sign of instability. Stick to slopes less than about 35 degrees or slopes sheltered from the wind if you observe unstable snow.You should expect a rapid increase in avalanche danger as a potent winter storm brings heavy snow beginning on Monday night.

You might trigger a small avalanche where dense drifts resting on weak snow formed at upper elevations.

11/19/2024,"In most places, there isn't enough snow for avalanches or there isn't a thick enough slab. The exception is upper-elevation slopes or gullies that are filled in with drifted snow. These slopes most likely face north, northeast, or east and sit directly below ridgetop. If you find hard-feeling, impenetrable snow, consider avoiding these areas and stick to places that weren't affected by recent winds.

The most likely place to find problematic snow is on north and easterly-facing slopes just below ridgelines and in gully features.

11/12/2024,"Most terrain is safe to travel, but you could trigger an avalanche on slopes with wind-drifted snow. Look for and avoid pillows of firmer snow that may crack under your weight. The avalanche you trigger will be small, but they could still be dangerous in steep, consequential terrain or above a gully.

11/5/2024,"Most slopes will be safe to travel on as there is not much snow. If you find continuous snow, avoid slopes with rounded pillows. If the snow is firm and hollow, you could trigger an avalanche. You are most likely to find this in gullies and close to ridgelines. Avalanches will likely be small but may push you into still-exposed rocks. If you experience cracking or collapsing, move to lower-angle slopes or slopes without a slab.

11/4/2024,"On most slopes, there isn't enough snow for avalanches. An incoming storm Sunday night may drop more than a foot of new snow in favored locations. However, with light easterly winds, this new snow will mostly fall on bare ground and is unlikely to form a slab on top of the areas holding a thin snowpack.If you are traveling above treeline, especially on steep northerly-facing slopes, there is a chance you could trigger a small avalanche where you find drifted snow resting on older snow.

11/1/2024,"Avalanche conditions are generally safe. Most slopes lack enough snow to trigger an avalanche. If you find a steep slope with continuous snow cover where the most recent snow drifted onto older October snow (or even a permanent snowfield), you might trigger a small avalanche. The most likely place to find this combination is on high-elevation shaded slopes just below ridgelines or in gullies. Unfortunately, the places with enough snow to ride are likely the same places where you could trigger an avalanche. Look for signs of drifted snow like textured pillows or fresh cornices. Cracking in drifted snow is an indication to avoid steep slopes. Think about the consequences of getting caught in any avalanche before committing to a slope. Early-season slides often result in nasty rides.
