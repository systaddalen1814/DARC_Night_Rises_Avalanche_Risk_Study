January 8, 2017 at 7:00 Natural and human triggered avalanches are certain today due to the significant amount of rain on snow expected below 9300 ft. and heavy wet snow loading above 9000 ft. Large, deep, destructive wet slab, deep slab, and wind slab avalanches will occur today as well as loose wet avalanches. Avalanches could run farther than expected and involve almost the entire snowpack. Avoid travel in or near avalanche terrain or runout zones today. EXTREME avalanche danger exists at all elevations.

December 18, 2010 at 8:03The avalanche danger will remain at EXTREME on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects and HIGH on   S-SW-W aspects steeper than 30 degrees at all elevations due to a combination of heavy snow and rain, high winds,   and a very widespread weak layer of buried surface hoar.  Widespread large natural and human-triggered  avalanches are certain  to continue today. Travel in or  near avalanche terrain  including low elevation road cuts and other steep hillsides is not recommended. ",SAC
