February,7,2024,"UPDATE 1:36 PM: Avalanches are happening now. Strong winds and heavy snowfall have overloaded the mountains. The avalanche danger has reached HIGH danger and traveling in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. 

The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across the mid and upper elevations for several avalanche problems. Pick your poison: Hard and soft slabs of wind-drifted snow. Soft slabs of new snow. Or you could trigger an avalanche that fails on a buried persistent weak layer. It's complicated and very dangerous.

In any case, the avalanche you trigger is likely a few hundred feet wide and could be 2 to 4 feet deep.",Ogden
January,18,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on all upper elevation aspects and mid-elevation aspects facing northwest through north and southeast aspects where new snowfall and elevated winds have created very dangerous avalanche conditions. Any avalanche triggered within the wind-drifted or new snow has the potential to step down 4-6 feet deep into the weak faceted snow within the snowpack, creating a very large and dangerous avalanche.

What to do? Stick to slopes less than a 30-degree today. Stay away from, and avoid slopes connected to, anything steeper than about 30 degrees.",Ogden
January,17,2024,"While the overall avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on most slopes early this morning, the combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds will cause the avalanche danger to rise to HIGH as the day progresses. Keep a close eye on changing weather conditions, as the avalanche danger will increase with the intensification of the storm. 

Today, there are three avalanche problems to watch for: (1) triggering a slab avalanche 4-6' deep in the weak faceted snow, (2) both soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow that would likely steep down into the weak snow below, and (3) sluffing and soft slab avalanches within the new snow.

What to do? Stick to slopes less than a 30-degree today. Stay away from, and avoid slopes connected to, anything steeper than about 30 degrees.",Ogden
January,16,2024,"A HIGH DANGER exists on many slopes.   
Today has avalanche accident written all over it. 
Large avalanches may be triggered in many areas.  Travel in or underneath avalanche terrain is not recommended. Remember that avalanches can be triggered at a distance or from the flats well below a slope.  Stepping out of bounds at a ski area is stepping into HIGH DANGER.",Ogden
January,15,2024,"THE AVALANCHE DANGER IS HIGH.  DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS EXIST.  AVOID BEING ON OR BENEATH STEEP TERRAIN OF ALL ELEVATIONS.
Natural and human triggered avalanches remain likely today.  Remember that avalanches can be triggered at a distance or from the flats well below a slope.  Skiing and riding out of bounds is stepping into HIGH danger.",Ogden
January,12,2024,"Dangerous avalanche conditions exist with a HIGH danger at mid and upper elevations and a CONSIDERABLE danger at lower elevations. Avalanches may fail 2-3' deep and hundreds of feet wide on a widespread persistent weak layer at all elevations.
Do not travel in avalanche terrain - do not be on, underneath, or adjacent to slopes approaching 30° or steeper.



With strong winds and several feet of snow forecast for this weekend, the avalanche danger is expected to increase.",Ogden
January,11,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and upper elevations as new snowfall and wind-drifted snow continues to add more weight on top of a buried persistent weak layer (PWL). The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at elevations below 8,000'. 

Step off your sled or off the skin track and take note of any wind loading, recent avalanches, cracking, collapsing, and whoomphing as these are all signs that our weak snowpack is overloaded. 
Today is a day to back off of and out from under steep terrain.",Ogden
January,10,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and high elevations due to recent heavy snowfall and wind-drifted snow which is sitting on top of a buried persistent weak layer (PWL). The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the lowest elevations below 8,000'. If forecasted snow comes through the lowest elevations in the Ogden Area Mountains could rise to HIGH danger by later this evening. 

Today is a day to avoid avalanche terrain.",Ogden
January,7,2024,"Update: 9:32 AM: The avalanche danger is HIGH across the upper elevation northerly facing terrain. There is also a CONSIDERABLE danger on low to mid-elevation slopes facing west to north and east. On these aspects and elevations, you'll want to avoid slopes where the wind has drifted the snow, forming either hard or soft slabs over our very weak and faceted snow. Avalanches can easily break 1-2 feet deep and over 100 feet wide. 

Traveling in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. Dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today. Natural avalanches are possible; human avalanches are likely.",Ogden
December,31,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on upper slopes facing northwest through north and east and CONSIDERABLE on the remaining upper-elevation and all mid-elevation slopes. New snowfall and strong winds have created very dangerous conditions. Avalanches triggered in wind-drifted or new snow could step down 1-4 feet into weak-faceted snow, resulting in large, dangerous, and potentially deadly slides. Both natural and human-triggered avalanches are likely.
With clear skies, backcountry riders may be tempted by the appealing conditions, but avalanche danger remains high. Most avalanche accidents and fatalities occur after peak instability. Fortunately, avalanche terrain can be easily avoided. Excellent riding can be found on lower-angled slopes.
What to do today:


Stick to slopes less than 30 degrees.
Stay well away from slopes connected to or below anything steeper than 30 degrees.",Ogden
December,30,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on all upper-elevation aspects from northwest through north to east, where new snowfall and strong winds have created very dangerous conditions.

April,12,2023,"A HIGH avalanche danger exists on all aspects and elevations.  These are dangerous conditions. 
Naturally occurring wet loose, wet slab, and glide avalanches are expected again today.  Avalanches will run long distances - even areas where there is currently little to no snow, such as trailheads or onto spring hiking trails.   Avoid being on or beneath steep terrain. 
Cornices and roof-alanches present a real danger today as well.",Ogden
April,11,2023,"Today, there will be a HIGH avalanche danger for wet avalanches. Avalanches will continue to happen naturally, and the debris will run far and stack up deep. Wet slab avalanches have the potential to be 2-5' deep and hundreds of feet wide running into areas where there is currently little to no snow, such as trailheads and onto spring hiking trails.

You will find a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on upper elevation north facing slopes where there is a chance for large cornices to fail, or glide cracks to release and trigger a deeper longer running avalanche.





Avoidance is key. Plan ahead for early exits and avoid being on or under sun warmed slopes.",Ogden
April,10,2023,"There will be a HIGH avalanche danger for wet avalanches. Avalanches will happen naturally today, and the debris can stack up very deep and run far especially in terrain traps like gullies. 
You will find a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on upper elevation north facing slopes where there is a chance for large cornices to fail, or glide cracks to release and trigger a deeper longer running avalanche.


Plan ahead for early exits and avoid being on or under sun warmed slopes. These avalanches could be 2-5' deep and hundreds of feet wide. If you are sinking through the top 6-8"" of the snowpack you're late, and it's time to exit the mountains and avoid any avalanche run-out zones.",Ogden
April,9,2023,"There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for wet avalanches on almost all aspects and elevations. Avalanches will happen naturally today, and the debris can stack up very deep, especially in terrain traps like gullies. It's possible with enough sunshine today that the avalanche danger could spike to HIGH for wet snow avalanches.
You will find a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on all upper elevation slopes for Cornice Fall. Stay well back from corniced ridgelines and avoid traveling on slopes with large, overhanging cornices above. 

With so much snow, watch for roof avalanches, especially as the day heats up.",Ogden
April,5,2023,"Expect the unexpected. The avalanche danger remains HIGH on all aspects and elevations today. Soft slab avalanches in the new snow are running farther and faster and breaking over wider areas than normal. These are unprecedented conditions. 

Avalanches will happen in the foothills not just at higher elevations.


With so much snow, also watch out for roof avalanches near structures, and be extra cautious near tree wells or any feature where you could fall head first and be unable to get out.",Ogden
April,1,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and upper elevations due to recent heavy snowfall, wind transported snow, and today's forecasted sun and clear skies. Avalanches may break 2-3' feet deep and 100-200'  feet wide.   The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the lowest elevations.


Give yesterday's storm time to settle out and stick to terrain under 30 degrees.  Travel in and below avalanche terrain is not recommended.",Ogden
March,31,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at the mid and upper elevations due to heavy snowfall and strong winds. Natural avalanches are likely and human-triggered avalanches are very likely.

Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended. 
Avalanches may run down into valley bottoms as avalanche paths are filled in and smooth.",Ogden
March,30,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on mid and upper-elevation slopes where new snowfall and days of high winds have created dangerous avalanche conditions. The elevated winds will continue to create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at all mid and upper elevations. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within layers of new snow at all elevations.
Both wind-drifted and new snow avalanches will likely fail 1-2’ deep, but have the potential to fail deeper at the new/old snow interface that is now down 2-5’ in places. For that reason, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today.


Avalanche danger will be on the rise into the evening, and any periods of heavy snowfall throughout the day have the potential to increase the avalanche hazard to HIGH if peak snowfall intensities pan out or the weather moves in earlier than forecast.",Ogden
March,27,2023,"A HIGH AVALANCHE DANGER currently exists in the Ogden area mountains.  Natural and human triggered avalanches in the new snow are very likely in steep terrain of all aspects.  The danger will probably peak this morning.
Heavy snowfall and strong winds over the past few days have created a layered and conditionally unstable snowpack.  Caution is essential today on all aspects and elevations.",Ogden
March,25,2023,"We have had 2-4' of snow since Monday. This new snow combined with winds picking up from a westerly direction has created an unstable snowpack and the avalanche danger is HIGH on upper elevation slopes where wind-drifted and new snow soft slab avalanches 1-3' deep and 100-150' wide are likely. Travel in avalanche terrain is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Mid and low-elevation slopes have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger where careful snowpack evaluation and terrain selection will lead you directly to safer terrain and soft snow. Avoid steep slopes if you see signs of cracking or collapsing in the new snow. 

There is plenty of great riding to be had on slopes under 30 degrees and not below or attached to steep terrain.",Ogden
March,24,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH in upper elevation terrain where natural wind-drifted and new snow slab avalanches are likely and human triggered avalanches are very likely. The danger is CONSIDERABLE in mid elevation terrain, and low-elevation slopes have a MODERATE avalanche danger where there has been less snow and lighter winds. 
Assessing changing conditions within the new and wind-drifted snow could mean the difference between a great day in the mountains and a close call. Luckily, lower angle storm skiing will be great all day long!",Ogden
March,15,2023,"The overall avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE but may spike to HIGH during periods of heavy snowfall this morning. High winds, warm temperatures, and heavy precipitation have created dangerous avalanche conditions on all aspects and elevations. The elevated winds will continue to create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at all mid and upper elevations. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within layers of new snow at upper and mid elevations, and wet snow at lower elevations. 
With strong winds, and overnight rainfall cornices and roof avalanches will be increasingly dangerous today.",Ogden
March,14,2023,"A MODERATE avalanche danger exists for developing soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow. These drifts will be most prevalent on west to north to east facing slopes.  Wet loose avalanches will also become a problem with rain to 8000' this afternoon/evening.  Cornices and roof avalanches will be increasingly dangerous.


I expect the avalanche danger to reach HIGH tonight into tomorrow with the storm.",Ogden
March,5,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH across all mid and upper-elevation slopes. Traveling in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. Here natural avalanches are likely, and human-triggered avalanches are very likely.

January,29,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across all aspects and elevations for sensitive slabs of wind-drifted snow. We also have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for new snow soft slabs and dry-loose avalanches. Human-triggered avalanches are likely, and natural avalanches are possible. 

We could see a period of heavy snowfall where the avalanche danger could spike to a HIGH danger for a few hours. This will depend on your location and how fast the snow falls from the sky.",Ogden
January,11,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at all upper elevations and at mid-elevation aspects facing west through north through southeast where heavy snowfall and strong winds have created very dangerous avalanche conditions. New snow and wind-drifted snow avalanches may step down into older facets, leading to large and destructive avalanches.
At all lower elevations and mid-elevation aspects facing southwest, and south where the persistent weak layer is less likely to cause avalanches the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE.
