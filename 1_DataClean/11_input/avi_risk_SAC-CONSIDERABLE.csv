January 5, 2021 at 6:59 Heavy and wet new snow has loaded our weak snowpack structure.  Human triggered persistent slab and wind slab avalanches remain a concern for today.  Just because the storm has ended and it's a sunny day, doesn't mean that avalanches can't occur.  CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger will exist at all elevations.    
",SAC
1,29,December,2020,"
December 29, 2020 at 6:58 Dangerous avalanche conditions continue with persistent slab and wind slab avalanche problems.  Multiple human triggered avalanches have occurred since our last storm 3 days ago.  CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations.  Advanced terrain management skills are required to avoid these avalanche problems today.
",SAC
2,28,December,2020,"
December 28, 2020 at 6:59 Dangerous avalanche conditions continue today following two consecutive days of avalanche activity. It is still not time to go big. Conservative, sub 30 degree slope angle terrain choices are highly recommended. Persistent slab and wind slab avalanches continue to occur and are stabilizing at slower than typical rates. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger continues at all elevations.
",SAC
3,27,December,2020,"
December 27, 2020 at 6:59 Unstable conditions are expected to continue today with a slower than typical post-storm stabilization process. Both persistent slab and wind slab avalanches occurred yesterday and could be triggered again today. Conservative, sub 30 degree slope angle terrain choices are highly recommended for today. Today is not the day to go big. Avalanche danger remains CONSIDERABLE for all elevations.
",SAC
4,26,December,2020,"
December 26, 2020 at 7:00 Strong winds and heavy snow will bring back dangerous avalanche conditions. The slabs of new snow will likely overload the old weak layers in sheltered areas. In wind-loaded areas, fragile slabs of wind drifted snow will exist. The complicated avalanche conditions mean that advanced route finding and decision making skills are required for backcountry travel. Traveling on slopes less steep than 30 degrees not connected to steeper slopes represents a safer choice. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations.
",SAC
5,17,December,2020,"
December 17, 2020 at 6:59 New wind and snow will add weight to an already unstable snowpack. Expect fragile slabs of wind drifted snow on wind-loaded slopes and unstable slabs of recent snow on old weak snow in more sheltered areas. This complicated mix of avalanche problems will result in dangerous conditions in the backcountry today. Large human triggered avalanches are likely. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Advanced route finding and decision making skills are required to avoid today's avalanche problems.
",SAC
6,16,December,2020,"
December 16, 2020 at 6:54 A weak snowpack structure exists throughout most of the forecast region with a buried persistent weak layer below the recent storm snow.  CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger continues due to this persistent slab avalanche problem and the possibility of human triggered avalanches.  Advanced route finding and backcountry decision making skills are required to avoid this avalanche problem.  Avalanche danger is expected to further rise into tomorrow as a winter storm impacts our area. 
",SAC
7,15,December,2020,"
December 15, 2020 at 6:54 Dangerous avalanche conditions continue with persistent slab and wind slab avalanche problems.  An unstable weak layer is buried in a large part of the usable terrain in our area.  CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations.  Advanced route finding and decision making skills are required to avoid todays avalanche problems.
",SAC
8,14,December,2020,"
December 14, 2020 at 6:50 The current avalanche situation is both dangerous and complex. Slabs of wind drifted snow and a significant new snow load overlying old weak snow means the possibility of encountering an avalanche in lots of different areas today both above and below treeline. Today is not a day to go big. Scale back terrain choices and slope angles. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations.
",SAC
9,18,April,2020,"
April 18, 2020 at 7:00 Little to no refreeze combined with warm weather and the potential for rain on snow means loose wet avalanches will be likely today. Some fresh slabs of wind drifted snow may also exist along the Sierra Crest above 8000 ft. Wet slabs also still warrant concern in some areas. The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE today. 
",SAC
10,6,April,2020,"
April 6, 2020 at 6:59 The storm has left unstable slabs of wind drifted snow and softer slabs of storm snow on steep slopes in both exposed and sheltered terrain. Recreating on slopes where these problems exist could trigger avalanches. Give the snowpack time to adjust to the new load before heading onto steep slopes. Plenty of nice snow exists on lower angle sheltered terrain. Expect CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger near and above treeline with MODERATE danger below treeline.
",SAC
11,25,March,2020,"
March 25, 2020 at 6:51 Wind drifted new snow has formed into dangerous wind slabs in above treeline and near treeline terrain. Unstable snow in the form of storm slab or loose dry avalanches may be encountered in wind protected areas below treeline. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists above treeline and near treeline with MODERATE avalanche danger below treeline.
",SAC
12,17,March,2020,"
March 17, 2020 at 7:00 Feet of new snow and shifting winds created dangerous avalanche conditions in the backcountry at all elevations. Human-triggered avalanches involving large slabs of drifted snow in wind-exposed areas and slabs of new snow in sheltered areas are likely today. In some places, deep slab avalanches involving all 5+ ft of the new snow failing on weak old snow are possible. Avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at all elevations. Be conservative and cautious in your terrain selection.
",SAC
13,16,March,2020,"
March 16, 2020 at 6:53 Dangerous avalanche conditions continue in the backcountry at all elevations with wind slab, storm slab, and deep slab avalanche problems. Terrain and route selections should be made deliberately and conservatively with the specific intention to manage today's avalanche problems. Avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at all elevations.
",SAC
14,14,March,2020,"
March 14, 2020 at 7:00 A strong winter storm has started to impact our area with high winds and heavy snow expected.  Wind slab and storm slab avalanches will become likely today at all elevations.  CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger will exist today with avalanche danger expected to rise to HIGH tomorrow as this storm continues. 
",SAC
15,3,March,2020,"
March 3, 2020 at 6:59 Increased warming today means that loose wet avalanches will become likely on sunny slopes as the day warms up. Some fragile slabs of wind drifted snow may also still linger at on leeward aspects. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. 
",SAC
16,1,March,2020,"
March 1, 2020 at 7:02 Shifting winds and new snow mean that fresh slabs of wind drifted snow could exist on almost any exposed slopes today. In more sheltered areas soft slabs of new snow or loose cohesionless new snow may exist. Expect wind slab, storm slab, and loose dry avalanche problems today. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists near and above treeline with MODERATE danger below treeline. 
",SAC
17,21,January,2020,"
January 21, 2020 at 7:00 Additional snow and wind today will increase the chances of avalanches.  Large destructive avalanches continue to be a concern with weak sugary snow buried deep in the snowpack.  CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations due to wind slabs and persistent slab avalanche problems.
",SAC
18,20,January,2020,"
January 20, 2020 at 7:00 Loose sugary snow 2 ft below the surface (or deeper in areas with wind drifted snow) has resulted in unusual avalanche conditions with significant uncertainty and the potential for large avalanches with severe consequences. Conservative route finding that avoids steeper terrain represents the best travel advice right now especially with soft snow still lingering on lower angle terrain. Some unstable wind drifted snow may exist at upper elevations. CONSIDERABLE danger continues below and near treeline with MODERATE danger above treeline.
",SAC
19,19,January,2020,"
January 19, 2020 at 7:00 The potential size and dire consequences of avalanches failing on a weak layer of snow at least 2 ft below the surface (or much deeper in areas with wind drifted snow) means our travel advice is still to avoid steep slopes. Plenty of great snow exists on lower angle terrain for recreation. At the upper elevations, some unstable wind drifted snow may also still linger. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger continues below treeline and near treeline with MODERATE avalanche danger above treeline.
",SAC
20,18,January,2020,"
January 18, 2020 at 6:59 A worrisome persistent slab avalanche problem exists below treeline and near treeline. Lingering unstable slabs of wind drifted snow may exist above treeline and near treeline. Warming air temperatures today may also trigger some loose wet snow instability. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger continues below treeline and near treeline with MODERATE avalanche danger above treeline.
",SAC
21,17,January,2020,"
January 17, 2020 at 6:57 There is a high degree of uncertainty today in regards to snowpack instability near and below treeline. A significant loading event onto a weak layer in the upper snowpack has occurred near treeline and below treeline. Significant drifting of new snow has occurred near treeline and above treeline. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger is forecast for all elevations.
",SAC
22,22,December,2019,"
December 22, 2019 at 7:03 New snow and wind today will cause the avalanche danger to increase to CONSIDERABLE in near and above treeline terrain as slabs of wind drifted snow become a problem. Human triggered wind slab avalanches will become likely. In more sheltered areas storm slab avalanches may become possible resulting in MODERATE avalanche danger. Variability in snowfall amounts and intensity during the storm will introduce some uncertainty around today's avalanche problems. 
",SAC
23,14,December,2019,"
December 14, 2019 at 6:50 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists above treeline and near treeline where wind drifted snow has formed into wind slabs. MODERATE avalanche danger exists below treeline due to the possibility of storm slabs and loose dry avalanches.
",SAC
24,13,December,2019,"
December 13, 2019 at 6:52 Avalanche danger is increasing today. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger is expected to develop this afternoon in above treeline and near treeline areas due to wind drifted snow forming into wind slabs. MODERATE avalanche danger is expected this afternoon below treeline due to the possibility of new snow forming into storm slabs.
",SAC
25,8,December,2019,"
December 8, 2019 at 6:59 Significant wind and new heavy snow during the storm have left large unstable slabs of drifted snow (wind slabs) on exposed near and above treeline slopes. In these areas, CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists and human-triggered avalanches are likely. In more sheltered below treeline areas, new heavy snow on top of older, lighter, weaker snow means MODERATE avalanche danger due to the possibility of storm slab avalanches.  
",SAC
26,6,December,2019,"
December 6, 2019 at 6:57 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for today in above treeline and near treeline areas due to a wind slab avalanche problem from increasing amounts of pre-storm blowing and drifting snow. Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger may exist as wind slabs form in wind exposed areas below treeline due to the strength of the winds. Numerous wind slab avalanches occurred yesterday and the avalanche problem will become more widespread today.
",SAC
27,2,December,2019,"
December 2, 2019 at 6:52 A mixture of warm temperatures, upper elevation snow, and rain will keep the avalanche danger elevated today.  CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger will exist in near and above treeline areas due to wind slabs.  Below treeline areas will have MODERATE avalanche danger due to storm slabs and loose wet avalanches.  Dangerous avalanche conditions exist.

December 1, 2018 at 6:52 Avalanche danger will quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE danger this morning at all elevations as new wind slab and storm slab avalanche problems develop. Anticipate areas of unstable snow both above and below treeline today. Snowpack instability is expected to increase rapidly. 
",SAC
47,20,April,2018,"
April 20, 2018 at 6:51 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger will develop today at all elevations as rapid warming of recent storm snow creates a loose wet avalanche problem. Avoid travel in or below avalanche terrain on slopes with marginally supportable to unsupportable wet snow conditions or on slopes where roller balls are occurring.
",SAC
48,16,April,2018,"
April 16, 2018 at 6:48 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists near treeline and above treeline today. MODERATE avalanche danger exists below treeline. Today's wind slab and storm slab avalanche problems have the potential to be exacerbated by rapid warming. Loose wet avalanches are unlikely today, but could become an issue if the sun comes out from behind the clouds. The avalanche situation could be fairly complex in the backcountry today. If in doubt, seek low angle terrain without steeper terrain above.
",SAC
49,7,April,2018,"
April 7, 2018 at 6:59 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations today. Natural avalanches are possible and human triggered avalanches are likely.

",SAC
50,23,March,2018,"
March 23, 2018 at 6:49 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists above 8000 ft and MODERATE avalanche danger exists in areas below 8000 ft. Today's avalanche problems include lingering wind slabs, loose wet avalanches, and possible deep slab avalanches. Daytime warming and strong March sunshine could make avalanches easier to trigger on sun-exposed slopes today.
",SAC
51,21,March,2018,"
March 21, 2018 at 6:59 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger will exist today due to a combination of loose wet, deep slab, and wind slab avalanche problems.  A moderate to strong atmospheric river storm will bring widespread rain and high elevation snow throughout the forecast area over the next couple days.  Dangerous avalanche conditions will exist with natural and human triggered avalanches expected.
",SAC
52,17,March,2018,"
March 17, 2018 at 6:54 Human triggered wind slab avalanches remain likely today and storm slab avalanche problems remain possible. In addition to these issues, the possiblity of an isolated deep slab avalanche cannot be ruled out. For these reasons, CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations today. Some avalanches that occur today could be very large and destructive and have very serious consequences.
",SAC
53,5,March,2018,"
March 5, 2018 at 6:59 Avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE for all elevations. Large destructive Deep Slab avalanches are an ongoing problem with large human triggered avalanches occurring both Saturday and Sunday. Loose wet and wind slab avalanche problems may also be encountered today. This is not typical Sierra post storm conditions. If going into the backcountry, deliberately choose terrain and plan a route that avoids exposure to the current avalanche problems. Do not underestimate potential avalanche size or likelihood of triggering.
",SAC
54,4,March,2018,"
March 4, 2018 at 12:11 UPDATE @ 12:00 pm. Danger increased to CONSIDERABLE. Large, dangerous, human-triggered deep slab avalanches are possible. Some already occurred today. These avalanches can be triggered remotely and would be almost impossible to survive. Wind slab and loose wet problems may also exist. Instability may lurk within areas of seemingly stable snow. If traveling in an area where deep slabs may exist avoid this problem by staying on slopes less steep than 30 degrees that are not connected to steeper terrain.
",SAC
55,3,March,2018,"
March 3, 2018 at 6:59 CONSIDERABLE danger exists at all elevations due to likely wind and storm slabs and possible deep slabs. Most avalanche accidents happen at CONSIDERABLE or MODERATE danger. Don't let ""powder fever"" corrupt good judgment. Make a plan before going into the backcountry that focuses on thorough and careful terrain and snowpack evaluation. Avoiding avalanche terrain and traveling on slopes less than 30 degrees without any exposure to steeper terrain above is recommended today. Avalanches could be large and destructive.
",SAC
56,2,March,2018,"
March 2, 2018 at 7:30 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations today due to likely wind slab and storm slab avalanches and possible deep slab avalanches. Another round of intense snowfall and wind impacting the region this afternoon and tonight should cause the avalanche danger to rise to HIGH in near and above treeline terrain. Most avalanche accidents happen at CONSIDERABLE or MODERATE, avoiding avalanche terrain and travelling on slopes less than 30 degrees without any exposure to steeper terrain above is recommended today.
",SAC
57,26,February,2018,"
February 26, 2018 at 6:59 As new snow accumulates today, the avalanche danger should rise to CONSIDERABLE in near and above treeline terrain and MODERATE in below treeline terrain. Expect fragile wind slabs near and above treeline and possible storm slabs in more sheltered areas near and below treeline. Human triggered avalanches will become likely today.
",SAC
58,19,January,2018,"
January 19, 2018 at 6:59 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations in areas that held snow cover prior to last night's snowfall. A combination of wind slab, storm slab, and persistent slab avalanche problems exist. Very large avalanches could occur below treeline. Complex and dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Powder fever could easily induce poor decision making today.
",SAC
59,8,January,2018,"
January 8, 2018 at 7:00 As more snow, rain, and wind impact the forecast area over the next 24 hours, human-triggered avalanches will be likely and natural avalanches will be possible especially later today and during the night. Avalanche problems include persistent slabs, loose wet avalanches, and wind slabs. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger will exist at all elevations. Avalanches could involve enough snow to bury a person. Dangerous avalanche conditions will exist across the forecast area.
",SAC
60,6,January,2018,"
January 6, 2018 at 6:59 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations due to a combination of loose wet, wind slab, and persistent slab avalanche problems. Intentionally choose terrain, evaluate slope aspect(s) for the presence or absence of avalanche problems, identify likely areas of triggering, and evaluate avalanche consequences in terms of potential size and down slope hazards. Determine how much you really know based on actual data vs what is a guess or pre-bias. If in doubt, make a more conservative choice.
",SAC
61,19,April,2017,"
April 19, 2017 at 7:00 As sun and warm temperatures cause rapid warming today, the avalanche danger will increase to CONSIDERABLE once last night's refreeze melts. Large human-triggered loose wet avalanches are likely today if people venture onto steep slopes where wet snow exists. Natural loose wet avalanches are possible. Some wet slab avalanches may also be possible today. The warming will weaken any lingering wind slabs keeping human-triggered wind slab avalanches possible today as well. Avoid slopes where wet snow or wind slabs exist.
",SAC
62,14,April,2017,"
April 14, 2017 at 6:55 Rapid warming caused by April sun and warm temperatures will cause the avalanche danger to rise to CONSIDERABLE today. Large human-triggered loose wet avalanches will be likely today if people venture onto slopes where wet snow exists. Natural loose wet avalanches will be possible. This warming will also weaken the lingering wind slabs making human-triggered wind slab avalanches possible. Avoid slopes where signs of warming or wet snow exist and slopes where wind slabs remain especially if they receive sunshine.   
",SAC
63,8,April,2017,"
April 8, 2017 at 6:59 CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists at all elevations today. Human triggered wind slab avalanches are likely on wind-loaded slopes and storm slab avalanches are possible in more sheltered locations. Dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Plan travel routes to avoid steep slopes where avalanche problems may exist. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. If areas receive more snow and higher snowfall rates than forecasted, more avalanche danger could exist. 
",SAC
64,28,March,2017,"
March 28, 2017 at 6:51 Rapid warming affecting recent storm snow will create areas of CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger today. Loose wet and wind slab avalanche problems are expected. Areas that did not undergo significant warming yesterday such as higher elevations or areas that spent most of yesterday under cloud cover will be particularly prone to avalanche activity. Identify and avoid areas of concern. Timing of travel in or below avalanche terrain will be critical for avoiding avalanche involvement.
