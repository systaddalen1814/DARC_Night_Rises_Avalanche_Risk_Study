### Combining all the data from the different areas.


This combines the data from every center into 5 master files, one for each risk
level. A column in the data set keeps track of which observation comes from which site
in the master files. We will remove any rows with missing data for the messages. We
could generate a histogram or series of histograms to count the number of observations
from each site and at each risk level.
