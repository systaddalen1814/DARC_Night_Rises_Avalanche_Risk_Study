Regional scale LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations.
"
21,"
November 21, 2020 at 6:55 Shallow early season conditions with lots of exposed and barely covered obstacles to hit will represent today's main concern. Avalanche activity has become unlikely on a regional scale. Unlikely does not mean impossible and overhangs of snow along ridges or a patch of unstable snow on an isolated terrain feature could still cause trouble today. LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations. 
"
22,"
April 14, 2020 at 6:45 Loose wet avalanche problems will develop quickly today in wind protected areas. Wet slab avalanches also warrant consideration. LOW avalanche danger very early this morning will increase to MODERATE avalanche danger as the morning progresses.
"
23,"
April 13, 2020 at 6:58 Firm snow surfaces this morning should melt to soft wet snow in response to strong April sun despite today's cooler temperatures.

45,"
February 11, 2020 at 6:58 Sunny conditions with elevated winds will continue today.  Firm and variable snow surfaces exist throughout the backcountry providing challenging travel conditions.  LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations with normal caution advised.
"
46,"
February 10, 2020 at 7:00 Firm surfaces, breakable crusts, and continued NE winds will continue to vex backcountry travelers today. Mostly frozen snow surfaces and very little new snow for the wind to blow around should keep significant avalanche activity unlikely today. LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations.
"
47,"
February 9, 2020 at 6:59 While blowing snow may be present today, significant avalanche activity should remain unlikely since old snow should remain frozen and new snow accumulation should remain limited. Variable firm snow conditions and gale force NE winds represent the main challenges for backcountry travelers today. LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations.
"
48,"
February 5, 2020 at 6:54 A warming trend beginning today will start to allow the snow surface to soften with the potential for small loose wet instabilities.  Normal caution is advised with LOW avalanche danger expected throughout the forecast region.
"
49,"
February 4, 2020 at 6:58 Cold temperatures and gale force winds will continue today at the higher elevations.  Small wind slabs in isolated areas may exist in near and above treeline areas with firm crusts at most elevations.  LOW avalanche danger is expected today.
"
50,"

"
51,"
February 2, 2020 at 7:00 Significant avalanche activity should remain unlikely today since old snow should remain frozen and the forecast only calls for limited amounts of new snow. Variable and firm snow conditions in the backcountry could present challenges for backcountry travelers. LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations.
"
52,"
January 30, 2020 at 6:42 Shallow, difficult to trigger slabs of wind drifted snow exist near treeline and above treeline. Warming conditions and snow surface melt will allow for rollerballs and maybe some small loose wet avalanches. Isolated small avalanches may occur today, well within the definition of today's forecast of LOW avalanche danger for all elevations.
"
53,"
January 8, 2020 at 7:00 New snow with high winds has made wind slab avalanches possible in near and above treeline areas.  LOW avalanche danger will continue in below treeline terrain.  Active weather is forecasted to continue for our area.
"
54,"
January 7, 2020 at 6:58 Avalanches continue to be unlikely throughout the forecast area, LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations.  Normal caution is advised when traveling in the backcountry.  A more active weather pattern is forecasted to start late tonight with increasing chances of snow into the weekend.

"
56,"
January 5, 2020 at 6:57 Triggering an avalanche remains unlikely on a regional scale. LOW avalanche danger does not mean no avalanche danger. Some areas of unstable wind drifted snow or cornices may still linger on isolated terrain features especially in complex or extreme terrain. Focus on using safe travel techniques, maintaining awareness, and having open discussions with your partners to avoid getting complacent.
"
57,"
January 4, 2020 at 7:00 On a regional scale, LOW avalanche danger exists for all elevations. Small, isolated areas of unstable snow from either wind drifted slabs or warming wet snow may or may not exist today. Don't let the danger rating lull you into complacency.
"
58,"
January 3, 2020 at 6:59 On a regional scale, LOW avalanche danger exists for all elevations. An isolated unstable area may be out there in the form of wind drifted snow or warming wet snow. However unlikely it is to trigger an avalanche today on a regional scale, today is not a no danger scenario.

February 6, 2018 at 6:56 The avalanche danger should remain LOW at all elevations today. Avalanche activity should remain unlikely. Some small loose wet instabilities may still form on isolated terrain features. 
"
118,"
February 5, 2018 at 6:58 LOW avalanche danger will exist at all elevations today. Daytime warming may allow some small loose wet avalanche problems to form on some isolated sun-exposed terrain features where snow coverage exists.
"
119,"
February 4, 2018 at 6:58 The avalanche danger will remain LOW today. Some small loose wet avalanche problems may still form on some isolated terrain features as the day warms up. Slab avalanches remain unlikely.
"
120,"
February 3, 2018 at 6:51 Avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. Isolated areas of unstable snow will form today. Loose wet is the avalanche problem to look for and avoid. Slab avalanches are very unlikely today on a regional scale.
"
121,"
February 2, 2018 at 6:55 Avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. Isolated areas of unstable snow will form today. Loose wet is the avalanche problem to look for and avoid. Slab avalanches are very unlikely today on a regional scale.
"
122,"
January 23, 2018 at 6:54 LOW avalanche danger exists at all elevations, but LOW danger does not mean no danger. An isolated persistent slab avalanche problem may still linger in a few areas. In the unlikely event that an isolated human-triggered persistent slab avalanche does occur, it could be large with significant consequences.
"
123,"
January 16, 2018 at 6:58 While the avalanche danger should remain LOW today due to the minimal snow accumulation expected, unstable snow may still exist in isolated areas due to lingering persistent slabs or very small pockets of newly formed wind slabs. If observations indicate that an isolated area of unstable snow may exist, choose different terrain. If more snow falls than forecasted, larger avalanche problems could exist and the avalanche danger could increase to MODERATE.
"
124,"
January 15, 2018 at 6:57 The avalanche danger remains LOW. Triggering an avalanche remains unlikely on a regional scale. LOW danger does not mean NO danger. Unstable snow may still exist in isolated areas due to lingering persistent slabs. Investigate the snowpack and determine if the persistent slab problem may still linger in your chosen area. If so or if you don't have enough data for a clear answer, chose a different area. Avalanche danger should increase tomorrow as a small storm impacts the area.
"
125,"
January 14, 2018 at 6:55 Triggering an avalanche has become unlikely on a regional scale; however, some unstable snow may still exist in isolated areas due to lingering persistent slab issues.  Avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. Investigate the snowpack and determine if the area you want to travel in is one of those isolated places where the persistent slab problem may still linger. If so or if you don't have enough data for a clear answer, chose a different area. 
"
126,"
January 13, 2018 at 6:55 Avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. While avalanche activity on a regional scale has become unlikely, human triggered persistent slab avalanches remain a concern in isolated areas.  Understanding if the avalanche problem does or does not exist within the snowpack on your terrain of interest should influence go/no go decision making much more than the regional scale danger rating.
"
127,"
January 12, 2018 at 6:57 Avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. On a regional scale, triggering an avalanche has become unlikely. Localized, isolated areas of instability may still exist where a human triggered persistent slab or wind slab avalanche could occur.

"
128,"
December 26, 2017 at 6:49 The avalanche danger remains LOW across the forecast area. Continue to use normal caution when traveling in the backcountry and watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features especially in areas where small wind slabs exist on top of weaker snow. 
"
129,"
December 23, 2017 at 6:56 Avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. Human triggering of avalanches is unlikely. Use the equipment and travel techniques associated with Normal Caution to help minimize the consequences of encountering an unexpected area of unstable snow.
"
130,"
December 22, 2017 at 6:55 Avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations and aspects. Small wind slabs exist in a variety of locations near and above treeline with human triggering unlikely. Look for and identify isolated areas of potential instability.
"
131,"
December 19, 2017 at 6:56 LOW avalanche danger will continue today. While triggering an avalanche remains unlikely, following safe travel protocols when in and around avalanche terrain remains a prudent choice. A winter storm forecasted to move into the area tonight and tomorrow will cause the avalanche danger to increase tomorrow and human triggered wind slab and storm slab avalanches may become an issue. If the storm moves in faster than expected, the avalanche danger could increase tonight. 
"
132,"
December 16, 2017 at 6:54 Avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. On a regional scale, triggering an avalanche is unlikely. Signs of isolated, difficult to trigger slab instability continue to show both above and below treeline. Normal caution is advised.

April 22, 2017 at 6:47 LOW avalanche danger early this morning will increase to MODERATE avalanche danger in response to daytime warming as the day progresses. Areas of loose wet avalanche problems are expected to develop on all aspects at all elevations today. Cornice collapse may continue to occur today, presenting an additional hazard to backcountry travelers.
"
140,"
April 21, 2017 at 6:59 LOW avalanche danger this morning will rise to MODERATE avalanche danger as the day warms up. Loose wet avalanches will become possible again today on slopes where wet snow forms. While triggering a wind slab has become unlikely except in a few isolated places, cornice failures remain possible today especially as warming weakens the cornices. Avoid slopes where wet, unsupportable snow exists and complex or extreme terrain where isolated wind slabs may exist. Give all cornices a wide berth.  
"
141,"
April 12, 2017 at 6:52 For most of today, avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. Following arrival of the incoming storm, avalanche danger will increase to CONSIDERABLE during the evening and overnight hours at all elevations.

During the afternoon hours, loose wet instability is expected at all elevations.
"
145,"
March 31, 2017 at 7:01 In most areas along the Sierra Crest, the avalanche danger will remain LOW today due to cooler temperatures, cold NE winds, and a lack of significant new snow accumulation. Across the Lake in the Mt. Rose area and in other high-elevation areas across the region where more snow fell, areas of MODERATE avalanche danger will exist in near and above treeline terrain where wind slabs may exist. If more warming occurs today than forecasted, some loose wet instabilities may form. 
"
146,"
March 30, 2017 at 7:00 Some areas of minor loose wet instabilities may exist in areas that are receiving rain this morning, but these concerns should diminish as the day cools off. The avalanche danger should remain LOW today due to the small amount of new snow accumulation expected out of this storm. LOW danger does not mean no danger and some small wind slabs could still form on isolated terrain features. If more snow falls than forecasted larger wind slabs could exist.  
"
147,"
March 29, 2017 at 6:55 Early this morning avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations. As the day progresses, MODERATE avalanche danger will develop at all elevations as loose wet avalanche problems develop in response to daytime warming.

"
148,"
March 18, 2017 at 7:00 LOW avalanche danger may only exist for a brief period early this morning due to little to no overnight refreeze. As the day warms up, the avalanche danger will quickly rise to MODERATE as loose wet avalanches become possible. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and move to less steep slopes or change activities once the snow becomes wet and unsupportable. Avoid slopes below large cornices and glide cracks. 
"
149,"
March 16, 2017 at 6:59 LOW avalanche danger exists this morning. The avalanche danger will increase to MODERATE as loose wet avalanches become possible due to daytime warming and intense spring sunshine.

"
154,"
March 4, 2017 at 6:59 LOW avalanche danger exists for all elevations until new snow starts to accumulate this afternoon/evening. Some areas of instability can still exist on isolated terrain features during LOW danger.
Once it begins snowing, the avalanche danger will increase rapidly as WIND SLABS and STORM SLABS form. During the night natural avalanches will become possible and the avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE. Expect dangerous avalanche conditions in the backcountry tonight and tomorrow. Check back tomorrow morning for the latest updates. 
"
155,"

"
172,"
April 17, 2016 at 6:28 Early this morning, avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations and aspects. Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger will form on slopes 35 degrees and steeper on all aspects at all elevations as loose wet avalanche problems develop in response to rapid daytime warming.
"
173,"
April 16, 2016 at 6:40 Early this morning, avalanche danger is LOW for all elevations and aspects. Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger will form at all elevations and on all aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper as loose wet avalanche problems develop in response to daytime warming.
"
174,"
April 13, 2016 at 7:03 LOW avalanche danger exists this morning. Some slopes steeper than 35 degrees on the E-SE-S-SW-W aspects may see enough sunshine and warming for the avalanche danger to increase to MODERATE due to the possibility of loose wet avalanches. Loose wet activity may also become possible on some NW-N-NE aspects in near and below treeline terrain if the sun hits those slopes. If more cloud cover persists today, loose wet snow will remain more isolated since less melting will occur.
 
"
175,"
April 6, 2016 at 6:58 After a short window of LOW danger early this morning, MODERATE danger will form on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on all aspects and elevations starting in the mid morning hours with the most sun-exposed aspects and progressing to other aspects during the day. Loose wet avalanches large enough to threaten backcountry travelers will be possible again today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Identify and avoid the areas where wet snow deep enough for loose wet avalanches exists. 
"
176,"

"
178,"
March 28, 2016 at 6:58 Snowfall amounts and avalanche danger will vary greatly around the forecast area today. Adjust terrain choices and route selection according to localized conditions. Near and above treeline on NW-N-NE-E-SE-S aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper, avalanche danger could range from LOW danger to CONSIDERABLE danger based on the size of newly formed wind slabs. Below treeline, avalanche danger could range from LOW danger to MODERATE danger on all aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper based on snowfall.
"
179,"
March 27, 2016 at 6:45 Early this morning, LOW avalanche danger exists for all elevations and aspects.

Loose wet avalanches are possible today. Avalanche size could be large enough to bury a person, especially if a terrain trap is involved.
"
180,"
March 25, 2016 at 6:51 LOW avalanche danger exists this morning, but MODERATE avalanche danger will form on sun-exposed E-SE-S-SW-W aspects steeper than 35 degrees at all elevations as last night's refreeze melts. Loose wet avalanches will become possible due to daytime warming today. Enough warming may also occur on the low elevation NW-N-NE aspects for some loose wet activity as well. Some loose wet snow avalanches could entrain enough snow to pose a threat to backcountry travelers especially in areas where terrain traps exist.
"
181,"
March 4, 2016 at 7:01 Increased cloud cover and winds combined with cooler daytime highs should keep the avalanche danger LOW for all elevations and aspects today. Some small loose wet snow instabilities may still form on isolated terrain features on slopes that receive rain today. Use normal caution in the backcountry. 
As a series of storms starts impacting the forecast area this afternoon and evening, the avalanche danger will increase quickly and avalanche problems like wind slabs and storm slabs will begin to form. 
"
182,"
March 3, 2016 at 6:57 The avalanche danger will remain LOW today. As the day warms up, some small loose wet snow instabilities may still form on isolated terrain features below 8500 ft. on sun-exposed aspects, on slopes where wet snow exists on top of drier snow, or on slopes that receive rain today. Use normal caution when traveling in the backcountry.

Isolated areas of loose wet instability may occur on W-NW-N-NE-E aspects as well.
"
185,"
February 27, 2016 at 7:00 The avalanche danger should remain LOW today due to increased cloud cover and winds, slightly cooler temperatures, and a prolonged melt-freeze cycle. Some small loose wet avalanches could still form on isolated terrain features on any aspect where wet snow exists. If the forecasted cloud cover does not materialize, the avalanche danger could rise to MODERATE on sun exposed slopes at all elevations due to loose wet avalanche issues.
"
186,"
February 26, 2016 at 7:01 This morning the avalanche danger remains LOW for all elevations and aspects. MODERATE avalanche danger will form on E-SE-S-SW-W aspects steeper than 35 degrees as human triggered loose wet avalanches become possible. Some small isolated wet snow instabilities may also form on northerly aspects. Most loose wet snow instabilities should remain small today but some could be large enough to pose a danger to backcountry travelers especially on slopes that receive direct sun and less wind today. 
"
187,"
February 25, 2016 at 7:37 This morning LOW avalanche danger exists on all elevations and aspects. MODERATE avalanche danger will form on E-SE-S-SW-W aspects steeper than 35 degrees as human triggered loose wet avalanches become possible due to daytime warming.

February 13, 2016 at 6:47 LOW avalanche danger is expected today for all elevations and aspects. Human triggered loose wet avalanches could still occur in isolated areas this afternoon on E-SE-S-SW aspects on slopes 37 degrees and steeper. Normal caution is advised.
"
193,"
February 12, 2016 at 6:40 LOW avalanche danger exists this morning while the snowpack remains frozen. As the day warms up and last night's refreeze melts, pockets of MODERATE danger will quickly form slopes steeper than 35 degrees on E-SE-S-SW aspects due to the possibility of loose wet avalanches. Small human triggered roller balls, pinwheels, and point-releases should comprise most of the loose wet activity, but some loose wet avalanches could involve enough snow to cause problems for backcountry travelers. 
"
194,"
February 11, 2016 at 6:58 This morning the avalanche danger is LOW. As the day warms up, pockets of MODERATE danger will quickly form on E-SE-S-SW aspects due to the possibility of loose wet avalanches.

197,"
February 6, 2016 at 6:56 LOW avalanche danger exists this morning. As the day warms up, some pockets of MODERATE danger may form on sun-exposed SE-S-SW aspects steeper than 35 degrees up to 9500 ft. due to the possibility of some small loose wet snow instabilities like pinwheels, roller-balls, and point release avalanches. Most of these loose wet snow instabilities should remain small and isolated, but a few could entrain enough snow to create issues for backcountry travelers on slopes that experience the most warming. 
"
198,"
February 5, 2016 at 6:56 This morning the avalanche danger is LOW on all aspects and elevations. Some pockets of MODERATE avalanche danger may form below 9000 ft. on sun-exposed SE-S-SW aspects steeper than 35 degrees as the day warms up, and some small loose wet snow instabilities become possible. The amount of warming that actually occurs today will dictate how widespread these possible wet snow instabilities may be. 
"
199,"
January 28, 2016 at 7:00 LOW avalanche danger exists on all elevations and aspects today. Some unstable snow could exist on isolated terrain features. As the next storm impacts the region tonight and tomorrow expect the avalanche danger to increase quickly.
"
200,"
January 4, 2016 at 6:56 For most of today, LOW avalanche danger is expected to continue for all elevations and aspects. Minor wind slabs not large enough to bury or injure a person remain an issue near and above treeline on NW-N-NE aspects. As additional snowfall accumulates, wind slab size will increase and avalanche danger is expected to increase to MODERATE danger sometime late today or tonight with a further increase in avalanche danger expected during the day tomorrow.

"
356,"
January 12, 2014 at 7:00The avalanche danger is LOW for most areas with consistent snow cover and nonexistent for areas without snow. On a few of the near treeline NW-N-NE aspects that received the most snow yesterday, some pockets of MODERATE avalanche danger may exist where human triggered avalanches may be possible on slopes steeper than 32 degrees. These more fragile areas are mostly likely to exist where small wind slabs formed above persistent weak layers.
