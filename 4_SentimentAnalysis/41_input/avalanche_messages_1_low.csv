During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.

11,17,2017,"With a decent shot of snow from this storm, you might find a few places to walk with your skis on. There is a generally LOW avalanche danger but be mindful of a couple things if you venture into steeper terrain today:

With additional snowfall and strong winds throughout the day, we could experience heightened avalanche conditions at higher elevations. Human-triggered avalanches might be possible especially on steep, wind-drifted slopes that harbored old, weak snow. ​
Weak, shallow snow exists under the new snow in higher elevation, N facing and shaded terrain. Best to avoid these areas. 
Avoid steep, freshly wind-drifted slopes.
Conditions can and will change rapidly. Follow safe travel protocols. 

Remember that each year we have early season close calls, accidents, and sometimes avalanche fatalities.  Montana has tragically suffered the first avalanche fatality of the season on October 7th.  Remember that traumatic injury is also more prevalent in the early season owing to the thin snow coverage - tread lightly.  Lastly, one must treat the unopened ski area terrain as the backcountry as the avalanche teams have yet to do control work.

1,6,2016,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE.  Human triggered avalanches are possible from recent wind loads and or deep weak layers failing in shallow snowpack areas.  Accurate snowpack analysis and terrain selection are crucial.  The avalanche danger is less pronounced in the mid and lower elevations.,Utah
12,13,2016,"Avalanche conditions are still very complicated in the Ogden Mountains.  There is a possibility of human triggered avalanches today; mainly in upper-elevation wind drifted terrain.  These avalanches, with the help of our persistent weak layer could break to the ground.  The chances of that are slim, but if you were to find the sweet spot large un-survivable avalanches could be triggered.  More than likely these wind slabs will fail on NSF (Near Surface Facets) that formed prior to last weekends storm.  Skiing the South side of the compass is usually a safe bet but with current conditions these slopes are just as dangerous as the North.  
With more snow coming this weekend get familiar with the snow surface in the Ogden Mtns.  There is still great riding conditions on low angle sheltered terrain, why push it when more cold snow is on the way this weekend.

At upper elevations, look for and avoid areas with wind drifted snow. At the same time evaluate how the new snow is bonded to itself and the old snow surface. 

At mid and upper elevations on more northerly facing slopes, there is a buried persistent weak layer that caused many soft slab avalanches this month. This layer has likely gotten wet and since gained strength as it cooled and refroze, but I'm not sure and it deserves evaluation.

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to. 
Lastly - Glide Avalanches. These are an isolated issue and usually occur in areas where the snow rest on smooth rock slabs. The release of a glide avalanche is unpredictable, but it is usually preceded by the opening of a visible glide crack. The main way to avoid these slides is simply avoid being under slopes with a large glide crack.",Utah

4,30,2019,"Regular avalanche forecasts with avalanche danger ratings have ended. We will continue to post all observations so please keep submitting them as you get out in the mountains.  

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to.",Utah

3,23,2018,"A complex and uncertain setup is in place, leading to an overall Considerable avalanche hazard: 
(1) Storm and wind-driven snow will possibly create sensitive storm and fresh wind slabs, especially through the morning hours during any period of high precipitation intensity.
(2) Over 2"" of water weight over a 24-hour window has rapidly loaded the snowpack, and this may be enough to get deeper slabs reactive once again.
(3)  1-2"" of rain  has created a wet loose avalanche problem at the low and mid elevations.

Unfortunately it takes work to know which slopes have these heightened avalanche conditions. There are several options if you want to get into avalanche terrain - do some investigating and careful assessments, go to low elevation slopes which have a LOW avalanche danger, or simply roll the dice. Another great option is to choose low angle slopes and not worry about avalanches at all.",Utah

Human-triggered loose snow sluffs and cohesive soft slabs within the new snow remain possible on steep slopes on all aspects today. Approach steep terrain with caution and utilize test slopes to see how the snow is behaving. Look for signs of instability such as cracking in the snow surface or fracturing soft slabs. Increasing winds this afternoon and tonight will blow and drift snow increasing the likelihood of human-triggered wind slab avalanches. Look for unstable drifts to form on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain.

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to. 
Lastly - Glide Avalanches. These are an isolated issue and usually occur in areas where the snow rest on smooth rock slabs. The release of a glide avalanche is unpredictable, but it is usually preceded by the opening of a visible glide crack. The main way to avoid these slides is simply avoid being under slopes with a large glide crack.",Utah
