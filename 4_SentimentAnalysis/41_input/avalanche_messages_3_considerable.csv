12,31,2024,"a special avalanche advisory is in effect from 4:30 pm monday until 5 pm wednesday. avalanche conditions are dangerous. you can easily trigger avalanches large enough to injure or kill you. backcountry travelers triggered many avalanches from a distance or the bottom of steep slopes in the last few days. safe travel will require giving most slopes steeper than around 30 degrees wide buffers. be aware of steep terrain above you, even if you are in gentle or flat terrain. slopes where wind-drifting is occurring will be even more dangerous. this could occur in cross-loaded features, so avoid slopes below cornices and with obvious pillows of wind-drifted snow.",caic
12,29,2024,"An Avalanche Watch is in effect for the Summit County mountains and the Front Range. Very dangerous avalanche conditions develop overnight on Sunday, lasting through Monday. Strong winds and heavy snow will result in long-running natural avalanches and easy-to-trigger, large, dangerous avalanches. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended on Monday.On Sunday, backcountry travelers can easily trigger avalanches where the winds have drifted snow into thick slabs. Avalanches can also be triggered from the flats below steep slopes or adjacent low-angle slopes. Give wind-loaded slopes a wide berth. Slopes with recently wind-drifted snow are the most dangerous. Shooting cracks and audible collapses are obvious indications to avoid steep slopes.

12,28,2024,"backcountry travelers can  easily trigger avalanches on steep slopes. slopes with recently wind-drifted snow are the most dangerous. the strong winds may form drifts farther below ridgelines than you expect. they may be wrapped around terrain features in unusual ways. you will find drifted snow on some open slopes below treeline, too. drifts may be smooth, pillow-like, show textured scallops, or feel chalky and hard. shooting cracks and audible collapses are obvious indications to avoid steep slopes. choose wind-sheltered slopes or ones less than 30 degrees in steepness.",caic
12,27,2024,"you can easily trigger an avalanche on drifted slopes that face north through east to southeast at upper elevations. steep, drifted slopes below ridgelines are the most dangerous areas. you can recognize drifted slopes by their smooth, pillow-like appearance and fresh cornice development. if you trigger a slide in recently drifted snow it can easily step down and grow larger and more dangerous. if you notice obvious signs of instability like shooting cracks and audible collapses, then move to slopes sheltered from the wind or less than about 30 degrees.",caic
12,29,2024,"Another wet storm will enter our area with high elevation snow, rain, and strong winds.  Slabs of wind blown snow will form in gully features, below ridges, and in open terrain.  Sloughs of new snow could slide downhill on existing firm snow surfaces.  Dangerous avalanche conditions will exist today as more snow and wind impact our forecast region.",sac
12,24,2024,"New snow and wind will make avalanches more likely today, especially near ridges, in gullies, and on windy slopes where wind-blown snow accumulates. Avalanches may also be possible on steep, sheltered slopes where the new snow piles up too fast. It will take constant effort to carefully reassess the snow and terrain as you travel in today's rapidly changing conditions.",sac
12,16,2024,Many avalanches have occurred in the last 48 hours in our forecast region.  The recent storm snow overlies previous weak sugary surface snow that has led to large avalanches occurring.  Strong winds will continue to create slabs of wind blown snow in open areas.  Active loading of new snow and wind will occur today with avalanches remaining likely.,sac
12,15,2024,A strong storm cycle deposited heavy dense snow with strong winds and left us with multiple avalanche problems.  This new storm snow now exists over previous weak surface snow.  Strong winds have created slabs of wind blown snow in exposed areas.  Dangerous avalanche conditions could exist today with large and destructive avalanches occurring.,sac
12,13,2024,"There are numerous possibilities for avalanches today, both large and small. The areas of greatest avalanche danger exist in locations that received 8 or more inches of new snowfall over the past 24 hours. In some areas, this new snow was deposited on top of a weak old snow surface that could lead to complicated and dangerous avalanche problems. HIGH avalanche danger is expected for Saturday.",sac
12,12,2024,A rapid increase in avalanche danger is expected this morning. The greatest avalanche danger will occur in areas that receive 6 or more inches of new snowfall today. This new snow is depositing on top of a weak old snow surface that could lead to complicated and dangerous avalanche problems.,sac
11,26,2024,"Our current storm continues today with more heavy wet snow and strong winds.  In areas that have weak sugary snow near the base of the  snowpack, this heavy snow will add additional load with the potential for large avalanches.  Strong winds will continue to form slabs of wind blown snow in open areas.  Dangerous avalanche conditions could exist today.",sac
11,23,2024,"A heavy load of rain and new snow was added to the snowpack last night. You could trigger an avalanche easily large enough to bury a person today in a variety of areas, including below treeline. Take a cautious approach to travel near avalanche terrain today, anticipating an increased likelihood of triggering an avalanche.",sac
4,6,2024,This morning the avalanche danger is MODERATE and will likely rise to CONSIDERABLE during the afternoon as heavy snowfall and strong winds create unstable avalanche conditions. Loose-dry and soft slab avalanches failing within the new storm snow will be the predominant avalanche problems today.,Utah
4,4,2024,"The danger for wet avalanches will rapidly rise to CONSIDERABLE on all steep east to south to west facing aspects this morning.  With direct sun and skyrocketing temperatures, dangerous wet avalanche conditions can be expected on and below steep solar terrain. Mid and lower elevation shady terrain will also produce wet slides and a MODERATE danger with today's heat and greenhousing.  You may also find some pockets of shallow wind drifted snow along the highest elevation bands today.
Cornices and roof avalanches remain significant objective hazards.",Utah
4,3,2024,"The danger for wet avalanches will rapidly rise to CONSIDERABLE on all steep east to south to west facing aspects this morning.

Cornices and roof avalanches are objective hazards for today.",Utah
4,1,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE in upper elevation terrain, where humans are likely to trigger wind-drifted snow avalanches. The mid-elevation slopes that received generally less wind and snow have a MODERATE danger. Low elevations have a LOW avalanche danger.
Use careful snowpack evaluation and cautious route-finding when you are near or approaching exposed ridgetops or areas where strong winds have transported new snow. If the sun comes out at any point during the day, the snow surface will rapidly heat up, and we could begin seeing small wet-loose avalanches on solar aspects.",Utah
3,31,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE in upper elevation terrain where humans are likely to trigger wind-drifted snow avalanches. The avalanche danger is MODERATE in mid elevation terrain and LOW in lower elevation terrain where it will still be possible to trigger avalanches failing within new or wind-drifted snow. 

Today, use careful snowpack evaluation and cautious route finding when you are near or approaching exposed ridge-tops or areas where strong winds have transported new snow.  Avalanches travel in packs, so if you see signs of instability, it is time to back off and choose lower angle terrain.",Utah
3,30,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger will start out at MODERATE on all aspects and elevations for new and wind-drifted snow. There is a LOW avalanche danger in lower elevation terrain. The avalanche danger could rise to CONSIDERABLE throughout the day with increased snowfall and wind. 

The travel advice for today is to use careful snowpack evaluation and cautious route finding. Avalanches travel in packs, so if you see signs of instability, it is time to back off and choose lower angle terrain.",Utah
3,28,2024,"This morning, there is MODERATE avalanche danger on all aspects at mid and upper elevations, where human-triggered soft slab avalanches are possible.
Throughout the day, the incoming storm may cause avalanche danger to rise to CONSIDERABLE on upper-elevation slopes facing northwest, through north, to east and southeast, where periods of heavy snowfall and strong winds could create dangerous avalanche conditions. The elevated winds will continue to form unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at upper elevations. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within the different layers of new snow from the past week.

During periods of higher snowfall rates (greater than 1"" per hour), avalanches will be easier to trigger. If the snowfall rates spike, the avalanche danger will spike as well. Watch for any signs of instability such as cracking and sluffing.",Utah
3,3,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE  across the mid and upper elevations for wind-drifted snow. Fresh hard or soft wind drifts (slabs) may be found on all aspects, including well down into drainage bottoms which are usually wind-protected. Avalanches could be 1-3 feet deep and large enough to bury a human. Conservative decision-making will be essential today.  

Out of the wind-drifted snow, you will want to assess how the new snow is bonding to the old snow surface. Dry-loose or soft slab avalanches are possible within the new storm snow.",Utah
3,2,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE  at the mid and upper elevations on slopes with new and recent slabs of wind-drifted snow. Fresh wind drifts may be found on all aspects, including well down into drainage bottoms which are usually wind-protected. 


As the storm arrives this afternoon, heavy snowfall and strong winds will likely increase the avalanche danger to HIGH.",Utah
2,27,2024,"Today, there is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on upper-elevation slopes where you are likely to trigger wind-drifted snow avalanches near ridgelines and terrain features.

The avalanche danger is MODERATE on mid-elevation slopes and LOW at the lowest elevations. 


Strong overnight winds created fresh wind-drifts at upper elevations and new snow may be covering them. These wind-drifts may break above you 1'-2' deep; and can be avoided by choosing terrain out of the wind zone.",Utah
2,23,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on mid and upper elevation slopes facing east and southeast for avalanches failing in a persistent weak layer buried 2-3' deep. There is a MODERATE danger on slopes facing west through south and southeast for wet snow avalanches.

2,22,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across the mid and upper-elevation slopes that face east, southeast, south, southwest, and west, where you can trigger a persistent weak layer avalanche that breaks to a crust with faceted snow 1-3 feet deep. 
We also have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger across all upper-elevation terrain for both hard or soft slabs of wind-drifted snow. Avalanches can fail 1-3 feet deep and hundreds of feet wide. Careful route-finding and conservative decision-making will be essential today.",Utah
2,21,2024,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across all mid and upper-elevation steep slopes for both Wind-Drifted Snow and a Persistent Weak Layer avalanche problem. Avalanches can fail 1-3 feet deep and hundreds of feet wide. The avalanche danger is also CONSIDERABLE for Wet-Snow avalanches across the low and mid-elevations. Avoid being in or underneath avalanche paths, as avalanches can travel long distances.
Careful route-finding and conservative decision-making will be essential today.",Utah
2,20,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations where you are likely to trigger a wind-drifted snow avalanche near ridgetops and on the leeward side of terrain features. These wind-drifts may be covered over by new snow, will be hard to see, and could break above you.
Mid and low elevation slopes have a MODERATE avalanche danger. There is a thin layer of facets associated with a crust now buried 1'-2' deep. We have been seeing avalanches triggered on this layer primarily on east-southeast and west facing aspects. 




Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today and if in doubt travel on terrain less than 30 ° in steepness.",Utah
2,19,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE  at upper elevations where it may be possible to trigger a wind-drifted snow avalanche near ridgetops and on the leeward side of terrain features.
Mid-elevation slopes have a MODERATE danger where we have had reports of avalanches failing on a new/old snow interface that was buried on Valentine's Day.  This storm interface has been associated with a crust in many locations and we have seen avalanches failing 12"" deep on southeast aspects. This avalanche problem is spotty-meaning that a snowpit in one location may not tell you if the slope you want to travel on has this buried layer. Dig on slopes you wish to travel on to determine if this interface is present. 



Sunny skies and filtered clouds could warm the snow surface particularly at lower elevations out of the wind zone, where you could see wet loose avalanche activity on the snow surface. 

Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today and if in doubt choose terrain less than 30 ° in steepness.",Utah
2,18,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all slopes across the upper elevations, where strong winds and new snow have created dangerous avalanche conditions The mid-elevation slopes that received generally less wind and snow have a MODERATE danger.

Any avalanches, wind-drifted snow, or new snow may be more sensitive today due to weak grains at the new snow, old snow interface, particularly on aspects with a southeasterly or easterly direction. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today.

If the sun comes out this afternoon, the snow surface could heat up, and we could begin seeing small wet-loose avalanches on solar aspects. Remember, even ""smaller"" slides can be dangerous in high-consequence terrain.",Utah
2,17,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on slopes facing west through north through east across the upper elevations, where moderate to strong winds have created sensitive slabs of wind-drifted snow. The mid-elevation slopes that received generally less wind and snow have a MODERATE danger.

The danger will rise to MODERATE on the solar slopes as the new snow heats up. Remember, even ""smaller"" slides can be dangerous in high-consequence terrain. Rollerballs are the first sign that the snow surface is becoming wet, and it might be time to switch aspects.




Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today.",Utah
2,16,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations that have soft slabs of recent or fresh wind-drifted snow. Slopes that aren't wind-loaded and slopes at low elevations have a MODERATE danger.
With increasing winds and periods of heavy snowfall possible, the avalanche danger may rise this afternoon, including possible natural avalanches.
Riding conditions will be superb on lower-angled slopes that aren't wind-affected.",Utah
2,15,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all mid and upper-elevation steep slopes for triggering soft slabs of Wind-Drifted Snow. We also have a CONSIDERABLE danger for New Snow dry-loose (sluffs), or soft slab avalanches failing within the recent storm snow. Strong winds and heavy snowfall will increase the avalanche danger throughout the day. Cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making will be essential today.",Utah
2,9,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the upper elevations and mid-elevation slopes facing west through north and southeast. The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the low elevations and mid-elevation slopes facing southwest and south. Avalanches may involve soft slabs of storm snow or wind-drifted snow 2' to 3' deep. On slopes facing the north half of the compass (especially north through east), avalanches may fail in a persistent weak layer and be up to 6' deep.

Avalanche terrain can easily be avoided as there are great riding conditions on lower-angled slopes on all aspects.",Utah
2,8,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across the mid and upper elevations for several avalanche problems. Pick your poison: Hard and soft slabs of wind-drifted snow. Soft slabs of new snow. Or you could trigger an avalanche that fails on a buried persistent weak layer. It's complicated and very dangerous.
In any case, the avalanche you trigger is likely a few hundred feet wide and could be 2 to 4 feet deep.",Utah
2,6,2024,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE above 8500 feet. Heavy snowfall and strong south winds since yesterday will make human triggered avalanches likely on any wind loaded slope. 

At mid and low elevations, the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Watch for any slope with wind drifted snow, but also the new snow could make some soft slab avalanches.",Utah
2,5,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the upper-elevation and MODERATE at the mid-elevations where triggering slabs of wind-drifted or storm snow are likely. Watch for cracking as a sign of instability. Avalanches may run fast and far on slick crusts underneath. 
There is also a possibility of triggering a large and dangerous avalanche, particularly on steep mid and upper-elevation slopes facing west through north and southeast, due to a buried persistent weak layer. If one of these avalanches is triggered, it will break 3-5 feet deep and well over a hundred feet wide.
There is a LOW danger at low elevations.",Utah
1,31,2024,"Today, there is a MODERATE avalanche danger that exists on steep west to north to southeast facing slopes for triggering a 2-5' thick hard slab avalanche that fails on a buried persistent weak layer of faceted snow.

1,30,2024,"A MODERATE DANGER exists on steep west to north to southeast facing slopes for triggering a 2-5' thick hard slab avalanche that fails on a persistent weak layer.
With clear skies and skyrocketing temps, the danger for wet avalanches will rise to CONSIDERABLE on all steep sunny (as well as low elevation shady) slopes. Don't overstay your welcome in the oven.",Utah
1,29,2024,"A MODERATE DANGER exists on steep west to north to southeast facing slopes for triggering a 2-5' thick hard slab avalanche that fails on a persistent weak layer.  Human triggered avalanches are possible and more likely in steep, thin, rocky terrain. 
With clear skies and skyrocketing temps, the danger for wet avalanches will rise to CONSIDERABLE on all steep sunny (as well as low elevation shady) slopes.  Don't overstay your welcome in the oven.  
Last, don't be surprised to trigger new but shallow soft slabs of wind drifted snow in the highest elevations today.",Utah
1,25,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation slopes facing west through north to southeast, and MODERATE on all remaining slopes. Any avalanche triggered within the new snow or wind-drifted snow has the potential to step down 2-5+ feet deep into the weak faceted snow within the snowpack.
There could be a more pronounced danger where the snowpack is shallower or thinner. While it may be possible to find this layering anywhere, the terrain along the periphery is most suspect. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making are essential today.",Utah
1,24,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on mid and upper elevation slopes facing west through north through southeast, and low elevation slopes facing northwest through east. There could be a more pronounced danger where the snowpack is shallower or thinner. 

Considerable means that dangerous human-triggered avalanches are likely. Cautious route-finding and conservative decision making is essential. Essential to what? Essential to making it back to the trailhead at the end of the day. Be careful out there.",Utah

1,20,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper and mid-elevation slopes west through southeast and at the lowest elevations northwest through east. The danger is MODERATE on lower and mid-elevation slopes facing west through south and southeast.
While we are seeing less avalanche activity on the buried persistent weak layer, we are still not seeing no avalanche activity and the chances of triggering one of these large avalanches 3-5' deep and a couple of hundred feet wide is more of a risk than I am willing to take.  There is great travel to be had on lower angle (less than 30°) slopes.",Utah
1,19,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the upper elevations and lower and mid-elevation slopes facing west through north through southeast. The danger is MODERATE on lower and mid-elevation slopes facing south and southwest. 

Avalanches may be large and destructive failing in a buried persistent weak layer, breaking down 3-5' deep and well over a hundred feet wide.

What to do: Avoid being on, underneath, or next to slopes steeper than 30°. Fortunately, there are plenty of lower-angled options where Wednesday's dense snow has created excellent riding and travel conditions.


With warm temperatures forecast, watch for wet-loose avalanches on steep sunny slopes and at lower elevations.",Utah
1,9,2024,"We have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger in the backcountry.  Natural avalanches are possible and human triggered avalanches are likely.  The danger is most pronounced on recently wind drifted slopes.  Know that avalanches may be triggered remotely (at a distance) or from below.  Collapsing and cracking is to be expected.  Most accidents and fatalities occur with a CONSIDERABLE danger.  Conditions will be changing rapidly today.

Remember, if you are stepping out of bounds at a ski area, you are stepping into CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger.",Utah
1,8,2024,"A CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists on nearly all steep slopes, even at the low elevations.  You will be able to trigger avalanches 1-2' deep at a distance, even from below.

There is a MODERATE avalanche danger on upper elevation west and southeast aspects and mid elevation northwest-north-east facing terrain. The avalanche danger is LOW on all other aspects.
 Recently formed wind slabs may be supportive enough to allow you to get further onto the slope before they break, making them all the more dangerous.  Cautious route finding and conservative decision making is essential.",Utah
12,15,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper-elevation slopes facing northwest, north, northeast, and east, where it's likely to trigger a persistent weak-layer avalanche. Here, avalanches may be triggered from a distance (remotely) and could be large enough to bury a human.

Cracking and collapsing are critical signs of instability and should not be ignored today. Human-triggered avalanches 1–3 feet deep are likely, with some natural avalanches possible as winds remain elevated throughout the day. Outside the wind zone, the new snow may still be reactive, with small avalanches capable of moving fast and traveling farther than expected.


Remember, early-season conditions make injuries more likely if caught in an avalanche of any size.",Utah
11,26,2024,"The avalanche danger may reach CONSIDERABLE today in the upper elevations, particularly on steep north to easterly facing aspects. Human triggered avalanches are likely, particularly in areas that see the most snow and wind.  Avalanches may fail within the new storm snow and they may also fail in the old faceted snow. A MODERATE danger exists on other northwest to easterly facing aspects on slopes that had pre-existing snow.  
Remember that cracking and collapsing are not to be ignored: they are key clues to instability.  Remember also that some avalanches can be triggered at a distance, even from below. 
Extra Caution should be advised with today's changing conditions.",Utah
4,17,2023,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE on solar aspects and low elevation northerly facing slopes as springtime sun and warm temperatures heat the surface.
The avalanche danger is LOW on upper and mid-elevation north facing slopes that will receive less daytime sun. If the wind does not keep the snow surface cool there is a chance that the avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on solar aspects this afternoon. 


Be prepared to adapt to changing weather and snow conditions. As soon as you or your machine start to trench into the snow it is time to get off of and out from under steep solar aspects.",Utah
4,13,2023,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger still exist for wet avalanches on many aspects and elevations.  Today's cold front will only mask any wet unconsolidated snow below.  I will admit to a great deal of Uncertainty with today's forecast, but I would continue to avoid steep terrain until we see a few days with a proper refreeze.   
Cornices and roof-alanches present a real danger today.  Glide avalanches remain very likely in steep terrain with glide cracks.",Utah
4,8,2023,"There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for wet avalanches on all sunny slopes facing southeast through west. There is also a MODERATE danger for wet avalanches on low elevation northerly facing terrain.

Even though there is barely a breath of wind this morning, I still wouldn't trust wind loaded slopes at upper elevations which also have a CONSIDERABLE danger.

North and east facing slopes should have dry snow today and a MODERATE avalanche danger for soft slab avalanches in the new snow.


With so much snow watch out for roof avalanches especially as the day heats up.",Utah
4,3,2023,"The avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE with today's heavy snowfall.  During periods of high snowfall rates, natural avalanches will be possible; human triggered avalanches will be likely.  Don't underestimate activity in the low elevation bands.

Cornices are not to be trifled with.  Give them a wide berth.  
Soft snow and good turns can be found on slopes under 30 degrees.",Utah
4,2,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE in  upper elevation terrain due to multiple days of strong winds that have transported recent storm snow into stiff drifts on the leeward side of the mountains. Avalanches may break 1-3' feet deep and 100-200'  feet wide.  The avalanche danger is MODERATE elsewhere.

3,11,2014,"The morning starts out with a CONSIDERABLE danger for steep wind drifted terrain, most pronounced in the mid and upper elevation northeast to southeast facing slopes.  Human triggered avalanches are probable in many areas, with wind drifts likely up to 18"" deep or more in heavily loaded terrain.  By the afternoon, the danger will trend toward MODERATE.  
The best and safest terrain today are one and the same - lower angle, mid-elevation (8-9500') northerly facing wind sheltered slopes...and it may be worth getting a bit later of a start today.",Utah
3,5,2014,"The danger will start off mostly LOW this morning, but will soon rise to MODERATE and then to CONSIDERABLE on the steepest sunlit slopes with daytime warming.  Natural and human triggered wet loose sluffs are a certainty. It's worth reading the fine print under the Wet Avalanche header.

1,17,2014,"The avalanche danger of triggering a deep slab avalanche is CONSIDERABLE on steep northwest through easterly facing slopes, above about 9,000’, and MODERATE on the same aspects at the mid elevations.  The unpredictable nature of these avalanches makes conservative decision making important.  The avalanche danger for wet slides and cornices breaking will rise to MODERATE as the day heats up.
Safer shady terrain to recreate on are slopes less steep than about 35 degrees, not directly below or connected to the side of a steeper slope and the sunny slopes before they heat too much.",Utah
1,15,2014,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE – large avalanches are possible in specific terrain.  The danger is higher in the Farmington Canyon area where numerous slides were triggered yesterday.  The uncertainty on a specific slope is great – not every steep slope will slide, but if it does, a slide has the potential to be very large.  This deep slab problem is most pronounced on northwest through easterly facing slopes, above about 8,500.  The avalanche danger for wet slides will rise to MODERATE on and below steep sunny slopes as the day heats up.

In very isolated places - upper elevation slopes facing northwest through southeast - in the Ogden area mountains, these drifts could overload buried weak layers, and larger slides 2 to 3 feet deep are possible.  In addition, avoid any steep slopes with recent drifts of wind-blown snow, which you will find at both mid and upper elevations.
Lower avalanche danger and excellent riding conditions will be found in wind sheltered terrain, and on the low angle slopes of all aspects.",Utah
12,26,2014,A pockety CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger remains above 9500 feet on northwest through east facing slopes.

Other slopes have a MODERATE danger because they have been scoured or don't have the old weak snow underneath.


Slopes at low elevations and south-facing slopes mid-elevations, simply don't have enough snow to ride and hardly enough snow to create an avalanche, thus they have a LOW danger.




What to do? The only viable strategy is to ride low angle slopes (less than 30 degrees in steepness) which are not steep enough for an avalanche. Also, avoid being underneath steep slopes.",Utah
11,25,2019,"The avalanche danger will be on the rise with the first of two storms.  The danger today will start out at LOW, move to MODERATE, and possibly move to CONSIDERABLE if we see enough snow and wind.   Remember: If snow is the question, Terrain is the answer: choose low angle terrain not beneath anything steep.  There will come a time (late afternoon?) when we will be able to trigger avalanches from a distance or below.",Utah
4,7,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at mid and upper elevations. Rain yesterday and heavy rain today up to 11,000 feet will cause both wet loose and wet slab avalanches.
Most avalanche activity will be wet loose avalanches. However, larger wet slab avalanches may occur as well. It's hard to forecast for wet slab avalanches but they could break 3-6 feet deep and be very destructive.
Large glide avalanches are also possible in places like Broads Fork where the snow rest on large rock slabs.",Utah
3,27,2018,"The avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE for wet loose avalanches at the mid and upper elevation steep east through west facing terrain.  You'll find an isolated MODERATE danger for deep slabs at upper elevation northwest through east facing terrain. LOW danger elsewhere.
Loose dry avalanches, and shallow wind slabs can be triggered today, especially at the upper elevation northerly facing terrain.  Even a small slide is serious if a ride would carry you off a cliff, into trees or down a long, icy slope.",Utah
3,24,2018,"Avalanche conditions are tricky and weird today. Multiple problems involving dry snow and wet snow exist. Until the snowpack has a solid refreeze, the best option is to avoid avalanche terrain by riding slopes less than 30 degrees without steeper ones above you.

Mid elevations have dangerous avalanche conditions and a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger. At least 7 wet slab avalanches occurred in these elevations yesterday. Wet loose avalanches (sluffs or point releases) should occur as well and can be triggers for larger wet slabs to release.
Upper elevations have a MODERATE danger because avalanches can possibly break in deeper layers of snow and create a large avalanche. Fresh wind slabs or drifts will be more common but shallow.
Low elevations have minimal snow and a LOW danger. Any snow remaining after Thursday's drenching rain, is likely to stay in place today.",Utah
3,17,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations. Layers of weak facets lurking in the snowpack 2-5 feet deep can produce large avalanches today.

Better and safer conditions can be found low angle terrain at the upper elevations, with nothing steep above you.",Utah
3,14,2018,"I expect the danger to rise to CONSIDERABLE for wet slab and wet loose avalanches today.  They may be most problematic on easterly (NE>SE) and westerly (NW>SW) aspects at the mid-elevations.  The danger may be more pronounced along the periphery of the Cottonwoods and more evident in Ogden and Provo. Note that wet avalanches may now include mid-elevation northerly slopes with today's warmth and high rain/snow line.
A MODERATE DANGER exists for human triggered slides 2 to 5 feet deep in isolated areas on predominantly (but not limited to) northeast to southeast facing slopes at the mid and upper elevations.  Localized pockets of shallow but perhaps sensitive wind drifts may be found along the higher elevations.

They are, however, more pronounced outside of the upper Cottonwoods or in thinner areas that have avalanched earlier this year.  TAKE NOTE:  Three were triggered yesterday unintentionally with two very lucky individuals caught and carried with no injuries.  These avalanches may be otherwise unsurvivable. 
The danger for wet avalanches on the steep sunny aspects may rise to CONSIDERABLE with direct sun and daytime heating.  Roof-a-lanches are likely and have resulted in fatalities in years past.",Utah
3,6,2018,Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE for both loose wet avalanches and persistent slab avalanches. The loose wet avalanches will occur somewhat predictably as strong sunshine heats up sun exposed slopes. The persistent slab avalanches are lurking but not on every slope. You'll have to dig into the snowpack and look for a layer of facets near an obvious layer of dust. Also watch for this problem on slopes with shallow snow like in steep rocky areas. Triggering an avalanche in new snow and wind blown snow remains possible.,Utah
3,5,2018,"The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE in upper elevations for fresh wind drifts, and above 9000' for persistent slabs.

When the snow becomes damps where you are, move to lower angle terrain or a cooler aspect.
On steep upper elevation slopes, there remains a MODERATE danger of triggering a new snow slide or fresh wind drift. Cornices can break back further than expected.",Utah
2,11,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE this morning on steep upper elevation slopes in areas that have received a foot or more of new snow, where new storm snow slides can be triggered, especially any wind drifts.  The danger is MODERATE in areas that received less snow, and the new snow should stabilize through out the day and become less sensitive.
The avalanche danger is also  MODERATE on on mid and low elevation slopes, where wet loose sluffs can be triggered on all aspects.",Utah
2,10,2017,"A CONSIDERABLE hazard exists at the low and mid elevations for wet loose avalanches. Travel on or underneath steep slopes at the low and mid elevations is not recommended today.
A MODERATE hazard exists for fresh wind drifts above 9000'. Strong winds may deposit drifts on all aspects and well down off of ridgelines. Cornices will only grow larger today - stay well back from the edge of corniced ridge-lines.
Today's dense storm snow is likely to be only around 6"" and should bond well to the existing snow surface. However, watch for the dense snow forming sensitive storm slabs at the upper elevations.
Forgive the oft-used cliche, but unusual weather breeds unusual avalanches.",Utah
2,9,2017,"The danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE for wet loose and possibly wet slab avalanches on all aspects at the low to mid elevations.  Even damp rollerballs and wet sluffs may be expected with provocation on all but the highest northerly elevations due to light rain and rapid warming.  These will be unusual conditions over the next 48+ hours.   Great uncertainty with these conditions warrants great caution.
Cornice-fall, Roof and Glide avalanches are all inherently dangerous...and all are quite possible today.  Ice climbing is not recommended.",Utah

1,27,2017,"There is a CONSIDERABLE hazard at the low and mid elevations for triggering an avalanche that fails on a persistent weak layer buried down 2-3'. Although this problem is localized, careful snowpack evaluation is required when traveling in avalanche terrain at the low and mid elevations. Be especially careful near creek bottoms, gullies, and other terrain traps where deep debris piles can accumulate.
Where there is no buried persistent weak layer, the hazard is MODERATE, with loose, dry sluffs possible on steep, sun-sheltered aspects. The sun will warm the soft, dry snow that has fallen this past week for the first time, and loose, wet activity will be a concern on solar aspects.
With plenty of loose snow available for transport, any spike in the winds will create sensitive wind drifts, particularly at the upper elevations.",Utah
1,26,2017,"The avalanche danger today is CONSIDERABLE which requires careful snowpack evaluations. Mid and low elevation slopes that seem safe may be the most dangerous because they may have a layer of surface hoar or small faceted crystals buried 2-3 feet deep. There is a lot of uncertainty about the distribution of this layer. There's a very good chance this layer exists and will produce avalanches on steep slopes near creeks, gullies and other terrain traps where a small avalanche can create a deep debris pile.",Utah

All other backcountry avalanche terrain has a MODERATE danger, including low elevation slopes. Avalanches 1 to 3 feet deep can be triggered, on slopes and remotely from a distance.  Careful snow pack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision making are essential for the backcoutnry traveler in avalanche terrain today.
There is unusually weak snow at the lower elevations – avalanches can be triggered below 8000’.  Avoid steep slopes and terrain traps such as gullies, creek beds, and trails and roads below steep banks where even a small slide can pile snow up deeply.",Utah
1,21,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations.  These loose snow avalanches and soft wind slabs are beyond manageable as the snow continues to pile up and be enough to trip up the overconfident backcountry skier or rider.  With natural activity, others above you, and cornice fall likely, avoid being in the runout zone as snow will continue to move in steep terrain today.  Debris piles will be more significant today.
Remember that with such low density snow, you don't even need to be on steep slopes to get your fill of powder.  The safest and best riding will be on slopes less steep than 35° with nothing steeper above.",Utah

At mid elevations, these problems are less likely thus these areas have a MODERATE avalanche danger.
There is great riding and great coverage at low elevations and on low angle slopes.",Utah
2,2,2016,The avalanche danger remains CONSIDERABLE in the upper elevations.  It's quite likely to trigger a fresh wind slab today on a variety of aspects in the higher terrain.  Wind transported snow has enhanced the chance for triggering an avalanche breaking into deeper weak layers although this is still a more of a remote possibility.,Utah
2,1,2016,The danger is CONSIDERABLE in steep wind drifted terrain and more pronounced on the north to west to south facing slopes.  The easterly winds result in unusual loading patterns and those that travel by rote may be surprised today.

There continues to be an isolated chance of triggering a deeper slide, breaking mid pack or to the ground.
There is amazing turning and riding in untracked powder on slopes that are less steep than about 35 degrees and not connected to or below steep terrain, so give the snow on steep slopes another day to stabilize.",Utah
12,25,2016,A CONSIDERABLE danger exists at the mid and upper elevations on many aspects.   Natural and human triggered avalanches are probable.  Those without excellent avalanche and route-finding skill should avoid being in or beneath steep terrain.  You can enjoy the Greatest Snow on Earth in our world class mountain resorts.,Utah
12,24,2016,"Expect the danger to rise to CONSIDERABLE in wind drifted areas.  With enough snow and wind, human triggered avalanches will become probable, with natural avalanches possible.  Watch for drifts in unusual locations, particularly on west to northwest facing slopes.  Cracking and collapsing are sure-fire indicators of instability.  Once again, the best and safest conditions will be in shady, wind sheltered locations on more gentle slopes with no overhead hazard.",Utah
12,17,2016,"Dangerous avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry.  There is a CONSIDERABLE Avalanche Danger on steep mid and upper elevation slopes, where human triggered avalanches are likely.  Natural avalanches are possible at the upper elevations.  Stay off of and out from under slopes steeper than 30 degrees, and avoid avalanche run out zones at all elevations.
Those with the careful snowpack evaluation skills, cautious route-finding and conservative decision making skills that are necessary for backcountry travel today will find great riding and lower risk on slopes less steep than 30 degrees and by avoiding avalanche runout zones, even at low elevations.
If you want to ride the steep slopes, head to one of our world class resorts today.",Utah
12,15,2016,"Today, conditions are complex and tricky. There are many possible avalanche problems and the easiest solution is to simply avoid avalanche terrain by riding slopes less than 30 degrees in steepness and not connected to any steeper slopes. We're in a holding pattern as a major storm approaches the area. The avalanche danger should start rising late this afternoon and tonight when rain and snow will be falling.
With very strong winds, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevation and wind loaded mid elevation slopes. With storm snow, wet snow, and persistent slab avalanche problems, the danger is MODERATE on non-wind loaded mid elevation slopes and all low elevation slopes.",Utah
12,12,2016,"It's a complicated avalanche picture out there as not only the new storm takes its time to adjust but the pre-existing snow structure takes time to adjust.   Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger still exists on steep mid and upper elevation wind drifted terrain.  This will be most pronounced on mid and upper elevation easterly facing slopes, but certainly not limited to this terrain.  Uncertainty, however, is high.  
A word to the wise: with great complexity and great uncertainty, great caution is required.  Remember that terrain is your friend:  excellent riding conditions can be found on sheltered slopes that are well less than 35 degrees in steepness.",Utah
12,10,2016,"If the winds continue and snow falls, you can expect a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger around the compass at upper elevations. This morning, the avalanche danger is MODERATE on all low to mid and upper elevation slopes, with fresh drifts of wind blown snow. As you're out today be mindful if the snow starts stacking up - be on the lookout for changing avalanche conditions as the day wears on. 
Warm temperatures have made the snow heavy and snow sliding off of roofs is a possibility - these slides create deep piles of snow very quickly. Have the kids play away from structures and keep your head up if you're shoveling.",Utah
12,9,2016,"The Avalanche Danger is rising, and backcountry travel in changing conditions is challenging.  This morning, the danger is CONSIDERABLE on all steep upper elevation slopes, and all mid and upper elevation slopes with fresh drifts of wind blown snow.  Other mid and lower elevations slopes have a MODERATE danger.
Small wet sluffs are possible at the mid to lower elevations, and roofs may shed their snow into deep piles this weekend.
Those with good avalanche and terrain evaluation skills can still head out and enjoy the new snow.    Stay on lower angle terrain - slopes of about 30 degrees or less, without steep slopes above you.",Utah
11,29,2016,"One must approach steep terrain with the mindset of a CONSIDERABLE danger today.  Give the snow some time to adjust as conditions are likely to improve over the next day or so.  You'll find plenty of good and safe riding in the mid-elevation, sheltered terrain even on lower slope angles in the low density snow.  If heading into steeper terrain - it's game on:  One-at-a-time, have your rescue gear dialed, have good communication, make a plan.  It wouldn't surprise me to see a few close calls today.",Utah
3,27,2015,"With only a minor refreeze last night and skyrocketing temps today, the danger will trend toward CONSIDERABLE for human triggered wet avalanches as the recent storm snow transitions from cold and dry to warm and wet.  While wet loose avalanches tend to run at a slower pace than their dry counterparts, it's more difficult to get untangled from flowing wet avalanches before they set up like concrete in the deposition zone.  Isolated pockets of lingering wind drifts may be found in the high alpine, more pronounced on north to easterly facing terrain.",Utah

It is unclear how dangerous conditions will get today so you must travel as you would with any heightened avalanche danger.  Do not linger under steep slopes, stay out of gullies, and plan your route so you don't end up on or below steep slopes that have become too wet later in the day.  The danger is MODERATE and may reach CONSIDERABLE with daytime heating.  Natural avalanches are possible.",Utah
3,8,2015,Most of the terrain has a MODERATE avalanche danger but there is a CONSIDERABLE danger still on the northerly terrain where human triggered avalanches are likely.

3,4,2015,"Avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep, upper elevation slopes facing north through east. Human triggered avalanches are likely in steep terrain.  All other upper and mid elevation slopes have a solid MODERATE danger.  There are three different avalanche problems:

new snow soft slabs and sluffs can be triggered, especially where wind drifted
damp sluffs may occur on the steep, sunny slopes
in isolated spots, slides 2 to 3 feet deep could break on faceted weak snow

Travel Advice: Start out slow and reevaluate often.  Choose tours with low angle terrain options – less steep than about 35 degrees - and reassess often, especially if you head into steeper terrain.  Our below average, shallow snowpack has lots of variability.",Utah
3,3,2015,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all slopes approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  Human triggered avalanche are likely.  Natural avalanches are possible, especially during periods of intense snowfall and wind.  New snow soft slabs and sluffs will be widespread, and a few slides on the more northerly facing slopes may step down into a deeper weak layer, resulting in a large dangerous slide.  Avoid travel on and below steep slopes today.",Utah
3,2,2015,"The danger today depends how fast the storm piles up weight on the pre-existing soft snow.  The danger should start at LOW this morning and rise to MODERATE by afternoon as the snow accumulates.  As you travel, be sure to test how well the new snow bonds to the underlying snow by jumping on small test slopes and digging down with your hand.  The danger may rise to CONSIDERABLE by Tuesday depending on what the storm does.",Utah
2,4,2015,A MODERATE danger exists in the high easterly terrain for new and developing wind drifts up to a foot or so deep.  A MODERATE danger for wet avalanches also exists at the lower elevations below 8000' in the northerly aspects.  The danger of wet avalanches may rise toward CONSIDERABLE on all steep southerly to westerly aspects if we see some clearing today.,Utah
1,26,2015,The avalanche danger may rise to CONSIDERABLE during daytime heating.

1,14,2015,There is generally a MODERATE avalanche danger today.  The danger of wet avalanches on southerly facing slopes may rise to CONSIDERABLE if the sun heats the newest snow enough.  Stay off of and out from under any steep sunny slope that is becoming damp.  Continue to be aware of wind slabs in the upper elevation terrain.,Utah
1,13,2015,Treat the avalanche danger as CONSIDERABLE until you can prove that it's MODERATE.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  Watch for any cracking within the new snow which indicates instability.  The danger could increase rapidly if the northeast winds start to drift snow mid day.  I suspect things will be manageable again today if you use your head.,Utah
1,1,2015,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist in the backcountry. Human triggered avalanches 1-3' deep are possible.  The danger is most pronounced up high on steep westerly aspects due to recent wind drifting...as well as north to easterly facing slopes above 8000'.
