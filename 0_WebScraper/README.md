### 0_WebScraper

This scapes the messages from our chosen avalanche centersâ€™ websites and
separates the files into CSVs by center, then again by risk. This way, each center has 5
associated files, one for each avalanche risk level. A data visualization was created for
each CSV to see where we had missing data.
