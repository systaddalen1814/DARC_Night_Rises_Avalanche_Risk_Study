Month,Day,Year,Danger Message
April,26,2014,"We are no longer issuing danger ratings, but heightened avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry and will continue through the weekend.  Watch for and avoid fresh wind slabs and sensitive cornices in drifted upper elevation terrain.  Loose wet avalanches entraining saturated new snow will become likely in steep terrain with inevitable seasonal warming.  Avoid steep sided gullies, trees below steep slopes, and other potential terrain traps.    Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully.
​"
April,24,2014,"Sustained southwest winds drifted Tuesday's fresh snow into shallow wind slabs and built-out cornices, creating pockets of MODERATE or level 2 danger on a few upper elevation slopes. You could trigger shallow wind slab avalanches in steep drifted terrain.  Seasonal warming will cause heightened avalanche conditions and a MODERATE danger of triggered loose wet avalanches entraining the fresh snow.  Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully.
​"
April,19,2014,"Overnight temperatures stayed in the mid to upper thirties, and the snow surface is only superficially refrozen.  Heightened wet avalanche conditions exist, and a MODERATE or level 2 danger could develop in some steep terrain by afternoon.  Wet avalanches are possible.  Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully.
​"
April,16,2014,"Freezing overnight temperatures helped to solidify the saturated snow, and the danger is mostly LOW or level 1 in the backcountry.   Heightened wet avalanche conditions, and a MODERATE or level 2 danger may develop on some steep sunny slopes by afternoon .   Use normal caution, but evaluate the snow and terrain carefully.
​"
April,13,2014,"Freezing overnight temperatures helped to solidify the saturated snow.  But recent hot weather has created heightened avalanche conditions, and there's still a MODERATE or level 2 danger in the backcountry.   Wet avalanches and large cornice-falls are possible in steep terrain, especially during the heat of midday.   Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully.
​"
April,12,2014,"After the forth night without a freeze,  very warm temperatures and direct sun will again cause dangerous avalanche conditions and a CONSIDERABLE or level 3 danger in the backcountry.    Natural and triggered wet avalanches will be possible on slopes steeper than about 30 degrees, especially during the heat of midday..   Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision making will be essential for safe travel in the backcountry today.
​"
April,11,2014,"After the third night without a freeze,  very warm temperatures and direct sun will again cause dangerous avalanche conditions and a CONSIDERABLE or level 3 danger in the backcountry.  The danger may rise to HIGH or level 4 in some steep terrain by this afternoon.  Natural and triggered wet avalanches will become likely on slopes steeper than about 30 degrees, especially during the heat of midday..   Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision making will be essential for safe travel in the backcountry today.
​"
April,09,2014,"Avoid and stay out from under steep slopes with saturated snow.  Very warm temperatures today after no overnight freeze will create dangerous wet avalanche conditions and a CONSIDERABLE or level 3 danger in the backcountry.  Natural wet avalanches are possible and triggered avalanches likely on slopes steeper than about 30 degrees, especially during the heat of midday.. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision making will be essential for safe travel in the backcountry today.
​"
April,08,2014,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist and there's a MODERATE or level 2 danger in the Backcountry.   Triggered wind slab avalanches and cornice falls are possible on drifted upper elevation slopes.  Sun and warming may create dangerous conditions, and the danger of wet or heat related avalanches will probably rise to CONSIDERABLE or level 3 this afternoon in some steep terrain.   Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully.
​"
April,06,2014,"Mostly stable conditions exist, avalanches are generally unlikely, and there's a LOW or level 1 danger in the backcountry this morning.  Even so, triggered cornice falls and wind slab avalanches are possible on drifted upper elevation slopes. Sun and warming will create heightened conditions and the danger will rise to MODERATE or level 2 this afternoon.  Wet avalanches will be possible during the warmth of midday.  Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully.
​"
April,04,2014,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry, and there's a MODERATE or level 2 danger in some drifted upper elevation terrain. Triggered cornice falls and wind slab avalanches are possible.  Wet avalanches will become more likely during the warmth of midday if the fresh snow is warmed and becomes saturated.  Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully
​"
April,02,2014,"Dangerous avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry, and there's a CONSIDERABLE or level 3 danger in some drifted upper elevation terrain. Triggered cornice falls, wind slabs, and persistent slab avalanches are possible.  Wet avalanches will become more likely during the warmth of midday if the fresh snow is warmed and becomes saturated.  Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision making will be essential for safe travel in the backcountry.
