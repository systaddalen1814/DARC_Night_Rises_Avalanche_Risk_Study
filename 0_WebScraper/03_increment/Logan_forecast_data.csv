April,15,2024,"During the spring, there are typically three different avalanche problems:
1. Wet Snow:  Wet loose avalanches, wet slab avalanches, and lastly glide avalanches.
2. New Snow:  New storm snow instability as soft slab avalanches and loose dry avalanches.
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind slabs - soft or hard drifts of wind-blown snow."
April,14,2024,"Overnight temperatures stayed well above freezing in the mountains, and hot temperatures and strong sun will elevate the avalanche danger to MODERATE at all elevations again today. Heightened conditions will develop on many slopes steeper than 30°, with wet avalanches, glide avalanches, and large natural cornice falls possible.


Evaluate snow and terrain carefully.  
Avoid terrain threatened by large overhanging cornices. 
Move off and out from under slopes with melt-softened saturated snow in the day's heat."

Avoid terrain threatened by large overhanging cornices. 
Move off and out from under slopes with melt-softened saturated snow in the day's heat."
April,10,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW, and if people use normal caution in the backcountry, they are unlikely to have problems with avalanches today. 
 Use normal caution while you travel in the mountains."
April,09,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW, and avalanches are unlikely this morning. However, drifting by increasing winds from the west could elevate the danger of human-triggered wind slab avalanches to MODERATE in exposed upper-elevation terrain. Also, the surface snow will probably become damp in sunny terrain during the day, and small wet avalanches may become possible.


 Use normal caution.  Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, especially in high drifted terrain."
April,08,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW today.   Avalanches are unlikely this morning, but the new snow will probably become damp in sunny terrain during the day, and small wet avalanches are possible.


 Use normal caution."
April,07,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today. Snowfall and strong winds have created heightened conditions in drifted upper and mid-elevation terrain where people might trigger wind slab and loose snow avalanches. 


Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully."
April,06,2024,"A cold, powerful, late-winter storm rolls through the zone today, and the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE. Heavy snowfall and strong winds will create heightened conditions in drifted upper and mid-elevation terrain where people might trigger wind slab and loose snow avalanches. 
Evaluate snow and terrain carefully."
April,05,2024,"Overnight temperatures stayed well above freezing at all stations again, but cooling and continuing strong winds should keep a lid on wet avalanche activity.  The danger is MODERATE, with natural and human-triggered wet avalanches and cornice falls possible.  Rain on the already-saturated snow could elevate the danger of wet avalanches on steep low—and mid-elevation slopes.  Also, areas with heightened conditions exist in drifted upper-elevation terrain where people might trigger hard wind slab avalanches.
 Evaluate snow and terrain carefully."
April,04,2024,"Overnight temperatures stayed well above freezing at all stations, and it will be even warmer in the mountains today than yesterday. The avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on sunny slopes steeper than 30°. Dangerous conditions will develop with natural wet avalanches becoming likely and large cornice falls possible off the high ridges.  People could trigger large, dangerous wet avalanches, especially in steep rocky terrain. There is also an elevated danger of triggering hard wind slab avalanches in some drifted upper-elevation terrain. 


Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and make conservative decisions. 
Avoid being on or under slopes with melt-softened saturated snow, and stay out from under large overhanging cornices that may fail in the heat of the day."
April,03,2024,"Sunny skies and warm temperatures today will elevate the potential for (slow-moving) wet avalanches at all elevations.  The danger could rise to CONSIDERABLE on sunny slopes steeper than 30°, with natural wet avalanches becoming likely and large cornice falls possible off the high ridges.  People could trigger large, dangerous wet avalanches, especially in steep rocky terrain. 


Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and make conservative decisions. 
Avoid being on or under slopes with melt-softened saturated snow, and stay out from under large overhanging cornices that may fail in the heat of the day."
April,02,2024,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry, and the danger is MODERATE.  Although becoming less likely, people could still trigger soft wind slab avalanches 1 to 2 feet thick in drifted upper-elevation terrain. Sunny skies and warming temperatures today will elevate the potential for wet avalanches on slopes at all elevations steeper than 30°.

Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully. Avoid being on or under slopes with melt-softened saturated snow, and stay out from under large overhanging cornices that may fail in the heat of the day."
April,01,2024,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry, and the danger is MODERATE.  People could trigger soft wind slab avalanches 1 to 2 feet thick in drifted mid and upper-elevation terrain. Partly sunny skies and warming temperatures today will elevate the potential for loose wet avalanches of saturated new snow on slopes steeper than 30°.

Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully"
March,31,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE this morning with heightened avalanche conditions in drifted mid and upper-elevation terrain. You could trigger soft slab avalanches of drifted storm snow 1 to 2 feet thick on slopes steeper than 30° as well as loose snow sluffs in steep terrain. The danger could increase to CONSIDERABLE in upper-elevation terrain and natural avalanches could become possible during periods of intense snowfall and/or strong winds. 

Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route finding, and conservative decision-making are essential tools for staying safe today - mainly in upper-elevation terrain that has received feet of snow and is exposed to the wind."
March,30,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE with heightened avalanche conditions in drifted mid and upper-elevation terrain. You could trigger soft or hard slab avalanches of drifted storm snow 1 to 2 feet thick on slopes steeper than 30°. Human-triggered sluffs are also possible in steep terrain. The danger could increase during periods of intense snowfall.

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully.  The best and safest riding conditions are in sheltered, shady, low-angled terrain."
March,29,2024,"The danger is MODERATE with heightened avalanche conditions in drifted mid and upper-elevation terrain. People could trigger soft slab avalanches of drifted storm snow 1 to 2 feet thick on slopes steeper than 30°.  Human-triggered sluffs are also possible in steep terrain, and if the sun peeks out from behind the clouds, loose wet avalanches entraining melt-saturated new snow could become a problem.

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully.  The best and safest riding conditions will again be found in sheltered low-angled terrain."
March,28,2024,"Heavy snowfall and significant drifting will elevate the avalanche danger today on many slopes in the backcountry.  The danger will likely rise to CONSIDERABLE in drifted upper-elevation terrain. Natural avalanches are possible, and people are likely to trigger slab avalanches of drifted snow 1 to 2 feet thick on slopes steeper than 30°. Human-triggered soft slabs and loose avalanches of storm snow will become more likely at all elevations as new snow rapidly accumulates.

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, make conservative decisions, and travel carefully with increased situational awareness.  The best and safest riding conditions will be found in low-angled terrain off and out from under slopes steeper than 30°."
March,27,2024,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist in drifted mid and upper-elevation terrain.  The danger is MODERATE, and people could trigger soft slab avalanches of storm snow up to around a foot thick on slopes steeper than 30°.  Solar heating during the day will elevate the danger, making natural and human-triggered wet avalanches entraining heavy piles of melt-saturated new snow increasingly possible.      

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, and travel with increased situational awareness in the backcountry.  The best riding conditions are most likely to be found in low-angled terrain."
March,26,2024,"The snow is stable, and the avalanche danger is LOW.  This afternoon, rapid or more-than-expected snow accumulation and/or an increase in winds could elevate avalanche conditions in some upper-elevation terrain. People might trigger small soft slab, loose, or wet avalanches of storm snow on slopes steeper than 30°. 

Use normal caution and increased situational awareness in the backcountry.  With shallow new snow, the best riding conditions are found in low-angled terrain."
March,25,2024,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist in drifted upper-elevation terrain, and the danger is MODERATE.  People could trigger small soft slab avalanches on wind-drifted slopes steeper than 30°. 

Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully."
March,24,2024,The avalanche danger is MODERATE today. Heightened avalanche conditions exist in upper-elevation terrain and human-triggered avalanches are possible on steep wind-drifted slopes. The snow surface prior to last night's storm was highly variable so there is some uncertainty as to how well the new snow will bond to the old snow. Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully as you travel today.
March,22,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, but with very warm mountain temperatures expected again, it could rise to MODERATE in some places during the day.  Natural wet avalanches, cornice falls, and glide avalanches may become possible.

If you start sinking into melt-softened saturated snow, plan to move to lower-angled terrain.  Avoid and stay out from under large overhanging cornices."
March,21,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, but with a poor overnight refreeze and very warm mountain temperatures expected again, it will rise to MODERATE during the day.  Natural wet avalanches, large cornice falls, and glide avalanches are possible on slopes steeper than 30°. 

People could trigger wet avalanches, so if you start sinking into melt-softened saturated snow, plan to move to lower-angled terrain.  Avoid and stay out from under large overhanging cornices."
March,20,2024,"With a poor overnight refreeze and very warm mountain temperatures expected again, the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE.  Natural wet avalanches, large cornice falls, and glide avalanches are possible in the midday heat on slopes steeper than 30°.

March,19,2024,"With a poor overnight refreeze and very warm mountain temperatures expected again, the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE.  Natural wet avalanches, large cornice falls,  and glide avalanches are possible in the midday heat on slopes steeper than 30°. 

People could trigger wet avalanches, so if you start sinking into melt-softened saturated snow, plan to move to lower-angled terrain.  Avoid and stay out from under large overhanging cornices."
March,18,2024,"The snow is generally stable, and avalanches are unlikely in the Logan Zone this morning. The avalanche danger is LOW, but it will become elevated, rising to MODERATE, especially on sunny slopes and at low elevations as saturated surface snow softens with daytime heating. Wet avalanches and cornice falls are possible in the afternoon with warm temperatures and powerful sunshine.

Use normal caution and leave or move to higher elevations or shadier slopes if you start sinking into warmth-softened saturated snow. Avoid and stay out from under large overhanging cornices."
March,17,2024,"The snow is generally stable in the Logan zone. The avalanche danger is LOW this morning but may rise to MODERATE with daytime heating. 
Wet avalanches could become possible in the afternoon with warm temperatures and strong sunshine, but elevated winds blowing from the east may keep widespread activity at bay."
March,16,2024,"The snow is generally stable and the avalanche danger LOW across the Logan zone except where the past few days' strong east winds formed drifts and hard wind slabs in unusual or unexpected places. There, the danger is MODERATE and human-triggered hard slab avalanches are possible in some very steep upper-elevation terrain.

Wet avalanches may become possible in the afternoon with warm temperatures and strong sunshine, but continued strong easterly winds should keep any significant activity at bay."
March,15,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across all upper-elevation steep slopes for wind-drifted snow (wind slab) avalanches. The strong northeast wind has created shallow, soft, or hard slabs of wind-drifted snow that could be sensitive to the weight of a rider. Human-triggered avalanches 1-2 feet deep are likely. 

The avalanche danger could rise to MODERATE on southerly facing slopes during the day for wet snow avalanches."
March,14,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE across all mid and upper-elevation steep slopes for wind-drifted snow (wind slab) avalanches. The strong northeast wind will create shallow, soft, or hard slabs of wind-drifted snow that could be sensitive to the weight of a rider. Human-triggered avalanches 1-2 feet deep are possible.   

Out of the wind-drifted snow problem, you will find a LOW avalanche danger where 4-6 inches of new snow sits over a firm base."
March,13,2024,"Overnight, several inches of new snow and drifting by winds from the northwest elevated the avalanche danger to MODERATE. Expect heightened avalanche conditions in drifted upper and mid-elevation terrain where people could trigger small soft slab avalanches of wind-drifted snow up to around a foot thick on slopes steeper than 30°. Long-running sluffs of new snow sliding on a slick melt-freeze crust are also possible. 

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, and pay close attention to potential terrain traps below; like trees, gullies, benches, sinks, or cliffs that even small avalanches might carry you into."
March,12,2024,"This morning, the overall avalanche danger is LOW, but it will be rising to MODERATE as the storm develops. While the new snow should not pose much of a threat this morning, if the storm comes in earlier or with higher snow totals than expected, we will begin to see long-running sluffs within the new snow. Additionally, the elevated winds may begin to create unstable shallow slabs of wind-drifted snow at upper elevations. Steer clear of being on or under large overhanging cornices.

Pay attention to changing weather patterns; if the storm arrives sooner than anticipated, the danger will rise sooner than anticipated."
March,11,2024,"The snowpack is generally stable, and the avalanche danger is LOW. The main concerns are isolated pockets of wind-drifted snow in exposed terrain at the upper elevations, along with looming cornices and lingering wet-snow instabilities after 24 hours of poor refreeze.

Pay attention to changing conditions and avoid being on steep solar aspects if the snow has become wet and unsupportable. Steer clear of being on or under large overhanging cornices, which may break back further than expected and may also trigger an avalanche below.



With the next storm system arriving Tuesday through Thursday, anticipate a rising avalanche danger."
March,10,2024,"The overall avalanche danger is LOW this morning but could rise to MODERATE on the southern end of the compass as the day warms up.
Pay attention to changing conditions and avoid being on steep solar aspects if the snow has become wet and unsupportable. Steer clear of being on or under large overhanging cornices, which may break back further than expected and may also trigger an avalanche below."
March,09,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning but will rise to MODERATE as the day warms up. Human-triggered avalanches are possible on steep slopes where the snow becomes saturated from the strong March sun and warm temperatures. Avoid being on or under large overhanging cornices which may break back further than expected and may also trigger an avalanche below. 

 Evaluate snow and terrain carefully as temperatures rise.

December,03,2014,"There's a LOW (level 1) danger and the snow is stable on most slopes in the Logan Zone.  Exceptions and pockets of heightened or MODERATE (level 2) danger  can be found on some drifted upper elevation slopes and in isolated or outlying areas with poor snow structure.  Fresh accumulations and drifting may cause the danger to rise during the day today.  Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully, continue to use safe travel protocols, and practice regularly with your rescue equipment.
​"
December,01,2014,"There's a MODERATE (level 2) danger on some drifted upper elevation slopes in the backcountry.  You could trigger fresh wind slabs in areas that picked up 6 or more inches of fresh snow yesterday and overnight.  Heightened avalanche conditions also exist on isolated slopes at upper elevation with poor snow structure.  There's a LOW (level 1) danger and the snow is stable on most other slopes in the Logan Zone.   Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully, continue to use safe travel protocols, and practice regularly with your rescue equipment.
​"
November,30,2014,"There's a LOW (level 1) danger and the snow is stable on most slopes in the Logan Zone.  Exceptions, heightened avalanche conditions, and a MODERATE or level 2 danger exist on isolated drifted slopes at upper elevation.    Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully, continue to use safe travel protocols, and practice regularly with your rescue equipment.
​"
November,29,2014,"There's a LOW (level 1) danger and the snow is generally stable on most slopes in the Logan Zone.  Exceptions, heightened avalanche conditions, and a MODERATE or level 2 danger exist on isolated drifted slopes at upper elevation.    Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully, continue to use safe travel protocols, and practice regularly with your rescue equipment.
​"
November,28,2014,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry, and there's a MODERATE or level 2 danger.  Triggered loose wet avalanches are possible today on steep slopes with saturated snow, and you might trigger wind slab avalanches on isolated drifted upper elevation slopes.   Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully, continue to use safe travel protocols, and practice regularly with your rescue equipment.
​"
November,26,2014,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry, and there's a MODERATE or level 2 danger.  You might trigger wind slab avalanches on some steep drifted upper elevation slopes.  The danger of triggered loose wet avalanches will rise with temperatures today in saturated snow at lower and mid elevations.  Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully, continue to use safe travel protocols, and practice regularly with your rescue equipment.
​"
November,24,2014,"Dangerous avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry, and there's a CONSIDERABLE or level 3 danger. You could trigger dangerous avalanches on slopes steeper than about 30 degrees.  Avoid drifted upper elevation terrain and steep slopes with significant recent accumulations on preexisting snow cover. 
​"
November,23,2014,"Dangerous avalanche conditions exist and there's a HIGH or level 4 danger on drifted upper elevation slopes. Natural and triggered wind slab and storm snow avalanches are likely.  The danger in sheltered terrain and at mid elevations is a level 3 or CONSIDERABLE, and you could trigger dangerous avalanches in steep terrain.  Avoid drifted upper elevation avalanche terrain and steep slopes with significant accumulations of new storm snow. 
​"
November,22,2014,"There is a MODERATE or level 2 danger in the backcountry this morning, with triggered wind slab avalanches possible at upper elevations.  The danger will rise significantly with a strong Pacific storm today.  Heavy snowfall and continuing strong winds from this will likely create dangerous avalanche conditions and a CONSIDERABLE or level 3 danger at upper elevations.  Especially as the new snow piles up, we should avoid steep drifted slopes at upper elevations..
​"
November,21,2014,"There is a LOW or level 1 danger in the backcountry today, but a strong Pacific storm is headed in our direction.  Heavy snowfall and strong winds from this will likely create dangerous avalanche conditions at upper elevations tomorrow and over the weekend.   Practice now using safe backcountry travel protocols and refresh with your rescue equipment.
​"
November,19,2014,"There is a LOW or level 1 danger in the backcountry.   Although rather unlikely, wind slab avalanches are possible at upper elevations on some steep slopes.  Avoid stiffer wind drifted snow, especially on smooth slopes with previous snow cover.   Get in the habit of using safe travel protocols and practice now with your rescue equipment.
​"
November,17,2014,"There is a LOW or level 1 danger in the backcountry.   Although rather unlikely, persistent slab avalanches are possible at upper elevations on some steep slopes, and there probably are pockets with a MODERATE danger.  Avoid stiffer wind drifted snow on smooth slopes with previous snow cover. 
​"
November,15,2014,"There is a MODERATE danger and storm snow avalanches are possible on any steep slope with significant fresh snow accumulation.  Avoid wind drifted snow on smooth slopes with previous snow cover.
