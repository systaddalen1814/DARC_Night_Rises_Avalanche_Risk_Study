Month,Day,Year,Danger Message
April,15,2024,"We're through issuing regular avalanche forecasts for the season but we'll post condition updates as warranted through the month. We will also continue to post recent observations.
Your primary concerns in the spring are loose wet avalanches from daytime heating, and wet slab avalanches. Plan to get in and out early before slopes become wet and sloppy. Consecutive nights without a freeze can increase the likelihood for wet slab avalanches.


New and wind drifted snow can also cause the danger to rise. Use the weather links below to aid in your trip planning."
April,14,2024,"It's been two nights without a refreeze and the danger is MODERATE for wet avalanche activity. This includes loose, wet, surface snow as well as wet slab avalanches. Signs of instability include rollerballs, pinwheels, and sloppy wet snow. Stay off of and out from under steep slopes when these signs are present. Expect the danger to increase throughout the day. 

There are a few large cornices out there. Give them a wide berth and stay out from under them.

Slick, hard surfaces  can be found at upper elevations and slide for life conditions exist. Consider carrying a tool for self arrest."
April,13,2024,"The danger will quickly rise to MODERATE for wet avalanches on sun exposed slopes. Signs of instability include rollerballs, pinwheels, and sloppy wet snow. Stay off of and out from under steep slopes when these signs are present. 

There are some slick, hard surfaces out there and slide for life conditions may exist. Consider carrying tools for self arrest if venturing into larger, steeper terrain."
April,12,2024,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  With daytime heating, the danger could rise to MODERATE for loose, wet, activity on sun exposed slopes. Signs of instability include rollerballs, pinwheels, and sloppy wet snow. 

There are some slick, hard surfaces out there and slide for life conditions may exist. Consider carrying tools for self arrest if venturing into larger, steeper terrain."
April,11,2024,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Small avalanches remain possible on isolated terrain features or in areas of extreme terrain. Be on the lookout for stiff, shallow deposits of wind drifted snow.

There are some slick, hard surfaces out there and slide for life conditions may exist. Stay situationally aware and consider carrying tools for self arrest if venturing into larger, steeper terrain. 

As temperatures increase throughout the week, so will the likelihood for loose wet activity."

April,07,2024,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Small avalanches remain possible on isolated terrain features or in areas of extreme terrain. Be on the lookout for fresh, shallow deposits of wind drifted snow.
There are many slick, hard surfaces out there and slide for life conditions may exist. Stay situationally aware and consider carrying tools for self arrest if venturing into larger, steeper terrain."
April,06,2024,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Small avalanches remain possible on isolated terrain features or in areas of extreme terrain. Be on the lookout for fresh, shallow deposits of wind drifted snow.
Practice safe travel techniques and carry rescue gear. Ski or ride steep slopes one at a time."
April,05,2024,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Small avalanches remain possible in isolated areas and extreme terrain. This includes:

Shallow, fresh deposits of wind drifted snow.
Loose, wet avalanches on sun exposed slopes as the day heats up. 

Practice safe travel techniques and carry rescue gear. Ski or ride steep slopes one at a time."
April,04,2024,"Most terrain has a LOW danger this morning. As the day heats up, avalanches involving wet snow will become possible on slopes that face E-S-W at all elevations. The danger will rise to MODERATE on these slopes by this afternoon.

Practice safe travel protocol and remember that during LOW danger small avalanches remain possible in isolated areas and extreme terrain."
April,03,2024,"The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE. Slabs of wind-drifted snow exist on all aspects above treeline. Strong NE winds yesterday morning deposited fresh slabs on leeward slopes. Additionally, it is still possible to trigger lingering wind slabs on Northerly aspects that were formed on Sunday.

Solar aspects will start with a LOW danger, but the danger will rise to MODERATE for wet-snow avalanches with daytime heating. Be aware of changing conditions on solar aspects today."
April,02,2024,"A MODERATE avalanche danger exists on steep wind loaded slopes near treeline and above that face NW-N-NE-E.  In these areas, human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow, 12""-18"" deep are possible. Shallower slabs of drifted snow may also be present on southerly aspects above treeline. Look for them on the leeward side of ridge crests and terrain features such as gully walls and sub-ridges. 

Out of the wind zone, the avalanche danger is generally LOW. Small avalanches on isolated terrain features are possible. This includes the potential for small, loose wet avalanches on sun exposed slopes as the day heats up."
April,01,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep, wind loaded, upper elevation NW-N-NE-E aspects. Human triggered avalanches 12""-18"" deep are likely in these areas. 

The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all other aspects near treeline and above with the greatest danger continuing to be concentrated on northerly facing slopes. On slopes facing the south side of the compass, the danger is not as widespread. In these areas, isolated wind drifts exist next to scoured surfaces, with terrain features making all the difference. 


Travel advice for the day: avoid steep slopes on the north side of the compass, especially above treeline. On all other aspects, avoid steep slopes that have recent deposits of wind drifted snow. The safest, and best turning and riding will be found on sheltered, low angle, northerly aspects."
March,31,2024,"A MODERATE danger exists for human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow, primarily on steep slopes near and above treeline that face NW-NE-SE. Anticipate a rising danger throughout the day if we see accumulating snowfall. Wind slabs may form in unusual places or be located further down slope than you expect. Seek sheltered, low angle terrain for the safest and best skiing and riding today."
March,30,2024,"Most terrain has LOW danger. An isolated or MODERATE danger exists for human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow, primarily on steep, upper elevation slopes that face NW-NE-SE. The danger includes both deeper drifts that formed earlier in the week, as well as shallow, recent deposits of wind drifted snow."
March,29,2024,"Most terrain has LOW danger. An isolated or MODERATE danger exists for human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow, primarily on steep, upper elevation slopes that face NW-NE-SE. The danger includes both deeper drifts that formed earlier in the week, as well as shallow, recent deposits of wind drifted snow."
March,28,2024,"Most terrain has LOW danger. An isolated or MODERATE danger exists on steep, wind drifted slopes above treeline that face NW-NE-SE. If you are looking to ski in the alpine, avoid steep slopes that have pillowy, or wavy looking deposits of wind drifted snow, especially in areas of consequential terrain.

With partly sunny skies and warming temperatures we may see some minor, loose, wet avalanche activity on sun exposed slopes. Signs of instability incliude rollerballs, pinwheels, and sloppy, wet snow."
March,27,2024,"Most slopes offer a LOW avalanche danger today. A MODERATE danger is found above treeline, where recently deposited slabs of wind-drifted snow exist. These slabs will be sensitive to the weight of skiers and riders. If are looking to ski in the alpine, you need to be able to recognize and avoid these fat, pillowy, wavy-looking deposits of wind-drifted snow. 

Today is going to be a beautiful sunny powder day with great turning and riding. Don't forget that heightened avalanche conditions exist on specific terrain features and human-triggered avalanches remain POSSIBLE."
March,26,2024,"Most slopes offer a LOW avalanche danger today. A MODERATE danger is found above treeline, where recently deposited slabs of wind-drifted snow exist. These slabs will be sensitive to the weight of skiers and riders. If are looking to ski in the alpine, you need to be able to recognize and avoid these fat, pillowy, wavy-looking deposits of wind-drifted snow."
March,25,2024,"The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE. Your primary concern today is soft slabs of wind-drifted snow that will be sensitive to the weight of skiers and riders. Fresh drifts will be found on all aspects above treeline, and near treeline on slopes that face NW-N-NE-E. 

The new snow is poorly bonded to hard slick crusts on many slopes, and dry-loose avalanches and shallow soft slab avalanches in the new snow are possible in steep terrain."
March,24,2024,"Snow started falling around 4 a.m. and will hopefully keep accumulating today. Even though winds were decreasing this morning, they blew strong from the south overnight and should increase again as they swing around to the north this afternoon.
For these reasons, the avalanche danger should rise to MODERATE today above treeline where you should be looking for soft slabs of wind drifted snow. Near and below treeline, the danger is LOW."
March,23,2024,"The avalanche danger today is LOW, but conditions are changing. Clouds should limit sunshine from heating the snow and creating any wet snow avalanche concerns. Increasing winds from the south should create shallow slabs of wind drifted snow to watch for and avoid."
March,22,2024,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW. Small avalanches are possible on isolated terrain features or in areas of extreme terrain. 




As the day heats up, be alert to signs of wet instability such as roller balls and pinwheels on sun exposed slopes. Stay off of, and out from under steep slopes if theses signs are present."
March,21,2024,"Most terrain has generally LOW danger. On upper elevation, northerly aspects, particularly in areas of extreme terrain, an isolated, or MODERATE danger exists for avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow. Even a small avalanche in these areas can have extreme consequences. 



In isolated areas on northerly aspects near treeline and below, a layer of weak faceted snow exists two feet below the surface. The distribution of this layer is spotty at best, and it has been shown to be non-reactive, but it deserves to be on your radar.

Be alert to signs of wet instability such as roller balls and pinwheels on sun exposed slopes. Stay off of, and out from under steep slopes if theses signs are present."
March,20,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE. Although the likelihood is decreasing, it remains POSSIBLE to trigger avalanches in slabs of wind-drifted snow that formed during the storm on Friday and Saturday. These wind drifts exist near treeline and above on slopes that face NW-N-NE-E. If you are seeking bigger objectives, evaluate each slope carefully.



In isolated areas on northerly aspects near treeline and below, weak faceted snow exists two feet below the surface. The distribution of this layer is spotty at best, but it deserves to be on your radar today."
March,19,2024,"The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE, and there are three different problems to look out for today.

Your primary concern is recently formed slabs of wind-drifted snow that exist near and above treeline on slopes that face NW-N-NE-E. These wind slabs have produced widespread natural activity, and remain sensitive to the weight of skiers and riders.
In isolated areas on northerly aspects near treeline and below, weak faceted snow exists two feet below the surface. The distribution of this layer is spotty at best, but it deserves to be on your radar today.
With a strong March sun and forecast warm temperatures, we'll see a rising MODERATE danger for loose, wet avalanches on sun exposed slopes as the day heats up. Signs of instability include rollerballs, pinwheels, and sloppy wet snow."
March,18,2024,"Human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow are still very possible on steep, wind loaded, northerly aspects near and above treeline, and the danger is strongly MODERATE in these areas. Avoid steep, wind drifted slopes. Dry, loose avalanches may also be possible in steep terrain.
In isolated areas on northerly aspects, a triggered wind slab may step down to a buried weak layer of faceted snow. Far from widespread, this layer has, nevertheless, been popping up from time to time, and the only sure way to know if it's there is to dig for it.
With a strong March sun set to show its face, we'll see a rising MODERATE danger for loose, wet avalanches on sun exposed slopes as the day heats up. Signs of instability include rollerballs, pinwheels, and sloppy wet snow. ​​​​​​"
March,17,2024,"Heavy snowfall and periods of high winds over the past few days caused a spike in avalanche danger. We are now trending down to an overall MODERATE danger for human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow, but areas of CONSIDERABLE danger may still exist on steep, wind loaded, northerly aspects above treeline. Avoid steep, wind drifted slopes, especially those with a northerly component to their aspect. Dry, loose avalanches may also be possible in steep terrain.
In isolated areas on northerly aspects, a triggered wind slab may step down to a buried weak layer of faceted snow. Far from widespread, this has been popping up from time to time, and the only sure way to know if it's there is to dig for it.
If the sun pokes out today, we'll see a MODERATE danger for loose, wet avalanches on sun exposed slopes. Signs of instability include rollerballs, pinwheels, and sloppy wet snow. ​​​​​​"
March,16,2024,"Recent snow accompanied by strong easterly winds have created a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on all aspects above treeline, and on steep slopes facing W-NW-N-NE near treeline. Human triggered avalanches involving both slabs of new and wind drifted snow are likely in these areas. As new snow accumulates today, the danger could be become more widespread and drop down in elevation. Be alert to changing conditions. 

A MODERATE avalanche danger exists on all other steep slopes and human triggered avalanches involving both slabs of new and wind drifted snow are possible.


We have been observing an unevenly distributed weak layer of faceted snow on northerly aspects near treeline and below. Avalanches in the most recent snow maybe capable of breaking down to this weak layer. Give the new snow time to adjust before venturing into steep, northerly facing terrain."
March,15,2024,"A storm is on our doorstep, bringing Easterly winds and a good shot of snow stacking up throughout the day. Shifting winds will blow and drift snow onto all aspects near treeline and above and the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Human-triggered avalanches in newly formed soft slabs of wind-drifted snow are POSSIBLE.

On shady slopes, near treeline and below, we are tracking a weak layer of faceted snow that exists about a foot below the surface. The distribution of this layer is spotty at best, but it is found in steep, sparsely treed, Northerly facing terrain. As snow stacks up over the next few days, and the wind blows, this layer is capable of producing avalanches.

There is a bit of uncertainty about how this storm will play out. If precipitation rates exceed the forecasted amounts, be alert to changing conditions and rising avalanche danger. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully."
March,14,2024,"Overnight, winds out of the NW whipped up a fresh round of drifts in alpine terrain. Above treeline, in the wind zone, it is POSSIBLE to trigger avalanches in recently formed soft slabs of wind-drifted snow and the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Hard slabs of wind-drifted snow that formed on Monday exist on Northerly facing slopes in alpine terrain. While the likelihood is decreasing, it remains POSSIBLE to trigger one of these older, hard slabs. All other slopes have a LOW danger.

On shady slopes, near treeline and below, we are tracking a weak layer of faceted snow that exists about 10 inches below the surface. The distribution of this layer is spotty at best, but it is found in steep, sparsely treed, Northerly facing terrain. As snow stacks up over the next few days, and the wind blows, this layer is capable of producing avalanches.

An incoming storm will cause the avalanche danger to rise late this afternoon and into Friday. Savvy backcountry travelers will be stepping-back and reassessing changing conditions as the storm develops."
March,13,2024,"This morning, most terrain offers a LOW danger. You will find a MODERATE danger above treeline on slopes that face NW-N-NE-E, where it is possible to trigger small avalanches in hard slabs of wind-drifted snow.

On shady slopes, near treeline and below, we are tracking a weak layer of faceted snow that exists just below the surface. The distribution of this layer is spotty at best, but it is found in steep, sparsely treed, Northerly facing terrain. As snow stacks up over the next few days, and the wind blows, this layer is capable of producing avalanches.

Incoming storms this week will cause a rise in the avalanche danger. It is no longer open season, and savvy backcountry travelers will be stepping-back and reassessing changing conditions."
March,12,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, but increasing winds blowing from the southwest might up the ante later today. Heightened avalanche conditions and MODERATE danger may develop in drifted upper-elevation terrain where people could trigger shallow hard slab avalanches of wind-drifted snow on slopes steeper than 30°.  Periods of heavy snow and drifting by southwest winds will elevate the danger tonight and tomorrow.

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, especially on high drifted slopes."
March,11,2024,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW. 
LOW danger does not mean NO danger, so don't let your guard down. Although unlikely, you could still trigger a small slide up to a foot deep on isolated slopes near and above treeline. Pay attention to increasing southerly winds as well which could create areas of wind-drifted snow on leeward-facing steep slopes."
March,10,2024,"Today the avalanche danger is LOW. 
Low danger does not mean NO danger, so don't let your guard down. Although unlikely, I think you could still trigger a small slide up to a foot deep on isolated slopes facing NW, N, NE, and E near and above treeline."
March,09,2024,"Today the main concern are slopes near and above treeline facing NW, N, NE, & E where winds drifted just enough snow to make a weak layer near the top of the snowpack able to produce soft slab avalanches about a foot deep. Look for subtle signs of minor drifting where the avalanche danger is MODERATE."
March,08,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE. You may still be able to trigger an avalanche 1'-2' deep where slabs of wind drifted snow exist over weak layers high up in the snowpack, primarily on slopes facing NW-N-NE-E.
In these same areas, there remains a low likelihood - high consequence scenario for human triggered avalanches failing on a persistent weak layer at the base of the snowpack. Minimize your risk by avoiding steep, rocky, thinner snowpack areas and slopes with complex terrain features."
March,07,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE. You can still trigger an avalanche 1'-2' deep where slabs of wind drifted snow exist over faceted weak layers high up in the snowpack, primarily on slopes facing NW-N-NE-E. In these same areas, slabs of wind drifted snow have added stress to a persistent weak layer at the base of the snowpack. Triggering an avalanche this deep is unlikely but the consequences would be devastating. Minimize your risk by avoiding steep, rocky, thinner snowpack areas and slopes with complex terrain features."
March,06,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE and human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow up to 2' deep remain possible, primarily on slopes facing NW-N-NE-E. In these same areas, deep drifts have added stress to a buried persistent weak layer increasing the likelihood for a much deeper avalanche. 

The danger decreases as you wrap around to the southern half of the compass, but isolated, shallower drifts may still be found, especially on slopes facing W and SE.  

Wind slabs are recognizable by their smooth, rounded appearance, and they may sound or feel hollow underneath. Cracking is a sign of instability."
March,05,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep slopes near treeline and above that face NW-N-E. Human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow up to 2' deep are likely. In these same areas, deep drifts have added stress to a buried persistent weak layer increasing the likelihood for a much deeper avalanche. Backcountry travelers should avoid all steep, wind drifted, northerly facing terrain. 

A MODERATE danger for wind slab avalanches can be found on all other aspects and elevations. Wind drifts are often recognizable by their smooth rounded appearance, and cracking or collapsing is a sign of instability. Avoid steep slopes that have recent deposits of wind drifted snow."
March,04,2024,"Recent snowfall and strong winds blowing from the WSW have created dangerous avalanche conditions. The danger is CONSIDERABLE, and skiers and riders are LIKELY to trigger avalanches in recent deposits of wind-drifted snow. The danger is most pronounced near treeline and above on slopes that face NW-N-E. Strong winds have reached below treeline, and the remaining slopes have a MODERATE danger. It is POSSIBLE to trigger slabs of wind-drifted snow on all aspects and at all elevations.

Persistent weak layers of faceted snow exist at the base of the pack on slopes that face W-N-E-SE. These layers will be stressed and potentially overloaded by blowing and drifting snow and the danger on these slopes is CONSIDERABLE.


Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making are essential for backcountry travel today."
March,03,2024,"A fast-moving cold front has delivered 8 inches of new snow, strong winds, and an increase in avalanche danger. The danger is CONSIDERABLE. Skiers and riders are LIKELY to trigger avalanches in recent deposits of wind-drifted snow. This problem is most pronounced on leeward slopes that face W-N-E where you can find drifts 12-18 inches deep. Swirling winds deposit fresh drifts around the compass and the remaining slopes have a MODERATE danger. It is POSSIBLE to trigger slabs of wind-drifted snow at all aspects and elevations.

Persistent weak layers of faceted snow exist at the base of the pack on slopes that face W-N-E-SE. These layers will be stressed and potentially overloaded by blowing and drifting snow and the danger on these slopes is CONSIDERABLE.


Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making are essential for backcountry travel today."
March,02,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE. Human triggered avalanches involving slabs of wind drifted snow are possible on steep slopes facing W-N-E-SE. Look for slabs of wind drifted snow on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features such as gully walls, sub-ridges, and rocky outcrops. 

Human triggered avalanches failing on a deeply buried persistent weak layer remain possible on slopes facing W-N-E-SE. The danger is most pronounced on steep, northerly aspects. This is a low probability/high consequence scenario. You can minimize your risk by avoiding steep, rocky areas and slopes with complex terrain features. 


A mostly LOW danger exists on S-SW aspects. Small avalanches on isolated terrain features are possible."
March,01,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE. Human triggered avalanches failing on a deeply buried persistent weak layer remain possible on slopes facing W-N-SE. The danger is most pronounced on steep, northerly aspects.  This is a low probability/high consequence scenario.

A mostly LOW danger exists on S-SW aspects. Small avalanches on isolated terrain features are possible."
February,28,2024,"Strong winds have been all over the map, blowing and drifting recent storm snow into fresh slabs on all aspects near treeline and above. The avalanche danger is MODERATE and it is POSSIBLE for riders to trigger avalanches 6"" to 12"" deep in wind-drifted snow. The danger is most prominent on Northerly aspects where deeper drifts extend further down slope than you might expect.

Although it is becoming less likely, very deep and dangerous avalanches failing on a persistent weak layer remain POSSIBLE on slopes that face W-N-E-SE. The danger is most prominent on slopes that face NW-N-NE-E and you are most likely to trigger one of these avalanches in steep rocky terrain with a shallow snowpack."
February,27,2024,"A quick-moving storm brings very strong winds and a few inches of new snow to the range. The avalanche danger is MODERATE and it is POSSIBLE to trigger avalanches in fresh slabs of wind-drifted snow on all aspects near treeline and above. 

Although it is becoming less likely, very deep and dangerous avalanches failing on a persistent weak layer remain POSSIBLE on slopes that face W-N-E-SE. The danger is most prominent on slopes that face NW-N-NE-E and you are most likely to trigger one of these avalanches in thin snowpack areas."
February,26,2024,"The overall danger remains MODERATE.  Although increasingly unlikely, human-triggered avalanches failing on a buried persistent weak layer remain possible on steep slopes that face W-N-E-SE. The danger is most prominent on steep, northerly aspects. You are most likely to trigger an avalanche in thinner snowpack areas. You can reduce your risk by avoiding steep, rocky areas and slopes with complex terrain features.

Early season storms have accumulated to the point that human triggered avalanches are possible, primarily on steep, wind drifted slopes that have continuous coverage of at least a foot or more of snow. On leeward slopes above about 10,000' you are likely to find recent drifts up to 12"" deep on about an equal base. These drifts will be scattered between areas of very thin coverage - expect to find them in depressions, and on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features. Avoid fresh deposits of wind drifted snow. Any ride in an avalanche, no matter how small, would be a very rough.

An avalanche triggered on this layer can be 2-3 feet deep. On sunny slopes facing W-S-E the danger will rise to MODERATE for wet loose avalanches as the day warms up. Be on the lookout for signs of wet activity today.
March,27,2022,"Near record daytime temperatures, and two nights without a re-freeze have created dangerous conditions in the backcountry. 
The avalanche danger will quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE on steep, sun exposed slopes. Natural and human triggered loose, wet avalanches are likely and wet slab releases are possible. 
On slopes facing the north half of the compass, melt water percolating down to the buried persistent weak layer may increase the likelihood for human triggered avalanches 2'-3' deep. A fair amount of uncertainty surrounds this scenario but current conditions make this kind of terrain high risk and low reward. Avalanche terrain should be avoided today."
March,26,2022,"With a strong sun and warming temperatures we'll see the avalanche danger rise to CONSIDERABLE on steep, sun exposed slopes today. Natural and human triggered loose, wet avalanches are likely and wet slab releases are possible. Avoid being on or under steep, sun exposed slopes that are wet and sloppy. 
A MODERATE danger remains for human triggered avalanches failing on a buried persistent weak layer on slopes steeper than 30 degrees that face NW-N-NE-E.  Avalanches failing on this layer will be 2'-3' deep and warm temperatures today may increase the likelihood. Steep terrain right around treeline is the most suspect."

November,05,2022,"We are not yet issuing regular forecasts or danger ratings. For the early season, we are monitoring conditions and posting updates as necessary. It is certainly looking like winter in the La Sal mountains. The latest round of snow delivered 8 inches bringing our base depth to about 22 inches. This is enough snow to be enticing and lure you off roads and summer trails. Don't be fooled, it is still low tide out there and rocks and stumps remain a very real hazard. A thin layer of faceted snow exists in the middle of snowpack. This layer is capable of producing avalanches anywhere a cohesive slab sits above it. You are most likely to find avalanche problems above treeline in areas of wind drifted snow. Remember if there is enough snow to ride, there is enough snow to slide. Any avalanche would be rough in these low snow conditions."
November,04,2022,"We're not yet issuing regular forecasts but are monitoring conditions and will provide updates as needed. Shallow snow conditions exist but if there is enough snow to ride there is enough snow to slide. Areas with wind drifted snow may be capable of producing slab avalanches over a foot deep. Cohesive slabs may be resting over a layer of weaker, faceted snow that fell in October, increasing the likelihood for human triggered avalanches.

For now, thanks for checking the forecast and stay tuned. We'll issue updates as conditions warrant with regular forecasts and danger ratings often starting in early December."
April,27,2021,A storm system moving through today could leave a little shot of new snow in the mountains.  Wind blowing the new snow into sensitive fresh drifts is something that you will want to keep an eye on.  Fresh deposits of wind drifted snow near the upper ridges would be likely areas where you might find something that cracks out on you.  This should be a manageable situation as long as you are aware of it.  Use test slopes and ski cuts to get a handle on how sensitive any potential new fresh drifts are.
April,20,2021,"Thursday's storm brought 10"" of new snow to the mountains and the weekend saw nothing short of a powder frenzy. Sunny skies and warmer temps on Sunday saw an increase in danger for loose wet avalanches, but the real story is the wind. Starting yesterday afternoon, moderate WSW winds shifted to WNW by evening averaging 25 mph and gusting to 40. This has put an end to powder conditions on the high north faces and created a danger for unstable deposits of wind drifted snow. Cross loading on north-facing terrain will be a factor, especially on slopes with an easterly component, and fresh drifts will be found on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features such as gully walls and sub-ridges in all upper elevation, wind exposed terrain. For a list of the most recent observations go here."
April,17,2021,"An overproducing storm brought 10"" or more of new snow to the mountains Thursday night. Human-triggered loose snow sluffs and cohesive soft slabs within the new snow remain possible on steep slopes on all aspects today. Approach steep terrain with caution and utilize test slopes to see how the snow is behaving. Look for signs of instability such as cracking in the snow surface or fracturing soft slabs. Increasing winds this afternoon and tonight will blow and drift snow increasing the likelihood of human-triggered wind slab avalanches. Look for unstable drifts to form on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain. And finally, with a strong sun and warmer temps on Sunday, look for an increasing danger for loose, wet avalanches within the most recent snow. Signs of instability include rollerballs and pinwheels. Get off of and out from under steep slopes when they become wet and sloppy."
April,16,2021,"Winter has returned with an overproducing storm that brought 10"" or more of new snow to the mountains. This is enough snow to create new snow avalanche problems.

Approach steep terrain with caution and utilize test slopes to see how the snow is behaving. Look for signs of instability such as cracking in the snow surface or fracturing soft slabs up to a foot deep. Northerly winds should remain mostly light today but will be on the increase tomorrow. Blowing and drifting of the new snow will cause the avalanche danger to increase. If you had your sights set on a large objective this weekend you should dial back your expectations."
April,11,2021,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW. As the day heats up monitor the snowpack for changing conditions and look for signs of instability such as rollerballs, pinwheels, and sloppy unsupportable snow.

April,09,2021,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW this morning. As the day heats up the danger for loose wet and wet slab avalanches could rise to MODERATE by afternoon. Signs of instability include rollerballs, pinwheels, and punchy or sloppy unsupportable snow. Work slopes according to their aspect and get off of and out from under steep slopes as they become wet and sloppy. With water moving through the snowpack, slopes do not have to be in the sun to be dangerous. Thin shallow rocky areas and terrain under cliffs should be avoided.

Coverage remains quite thin and a ride in an avalanche would be brutal in these shallow snow conditions. Enjoy the fresh snow and beautiful sunny day but beware of lingering obstacles below the surface and keep your stoke reigned in!"
December,10,2021,"Heavy snowfall combined with wind has created a HIGH avalanche danger on steep, upper elevation terrain that faces NW through E. The danger is CONSIDERABLE at mid elevations on these same aspects. In these areas, new and wind drifted snow is sitting on top of older, weaker snow and human triggered avalanches are likely if not certain. Coverage remains quite thin and a ride in an avalanche would be brutal in these shallow snow conditions. The deep snow will make travel difficult today and lower angle slopes will be difficult to turn on. If you are hankering to get out and enjoy the new snow plan for a simple walk in the woods. The season is early, don't let your stoke get the best of you."
December,09,2021,"The avalanche danger will be on the increase over the next 24 hours as a strong storm system moves into our area. Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE but will likely reach CONSIDERABLE by this evening as new and wind drifted snow form dangerous slabs, primarily on steep, upper elevation, northerly facing slopes. Backcountry travelers need to be alert to changing conditions and avoid steep wind drifted slopes. A ride in an avalanche would be brutal in these shallow snow conditions. The overall snow cover is quite thin and travel is marginal with rocks, stumps, and deadfall posing serious additional hazards."

December,12,2020,"The first storm in weeks looks like it could produce up to 6"" of snow along with moderate to strong ridgetop winds. Depending on amounts, blowing and drifting snow could create our first avalanche concerns of the season, particularly at upper elevations where fresh drifts will overly a layer of, weak, sugary, faceted snow on northerly aspects.  
Snow cover is currently limited to northerly facing, shady slopes above about 9500' and depths range from a few inches to 18"" or more at the highest elevation. All sun-exposed slopes are bare. Travel off of snow-packed roads is not recommended. If for some reason, however, you find yourself in upper elevation, northerly facing terrain, be alert to signs of increasing avalanche danger as a result of blowing and drifting snow.

October,31,2020,"Greetings winter enthusiasts, the first snow fell in the La Sal Mountains on Oct 25. Totals ranged from 6"" - 12"". Aerial observer Chris Benson was flying around and took these pictures. Chris Bolos was out and about and managed the first turns of the season. Though avalanches are not yet a concern, it will be time to start mapping how much of this snow sticks around on the high north faces. Any that does, will surely become a layer of loose, faceted snow at the bottom of the snowpack. I'll begin issuing regular forecasts sometime in November as snow dictates."

Smaller avalanches of wind drifted snow should be happening naturally today.
Avalanches may break much deeper in the snowpack on buried weak layers. These larger slides will be deadly and make for dangerous avalanche conditions. The best option is to avoid avalanche terrain today.
At all elevations and aspects, the new snow will continue accumulating today and should easily produce shallow avalanches."

New snow amounts and wind will dictate the rise in danger, and we could start to see sensitive wind drifts and a MODERATE avalanche danger developing by tomorrow. Look for fresh drifts to form on the lee sides of ridge crests and terrain features in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain. Be alert to signs of instability such as cracking in the snow surface. It may also be possible to trigger an avalanche on a buried persistent weak layer on steep, rocky, northerly facing terrain."

December,07,2019,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW and mostly stable snow conditions exist. LOW danger doesn't mean no danger, and here are a couple things to keep in mind. 

Persistent Weak Layer - There is a layer of moderately weak faceted snow at the base of the snowpack. Though unlikely, it may be possible to trigger an avalanche on this weak layer on steep, northerly facing aspects.
Wind Drifted Snow - There may still be some isolated wind slabs scattered around the high country and increasing winds today may form a few more. Always be on the lookout for areas of wind drifted snow. Look for cracking in the snow surface and avoid slopes that sound and feel hollow like a drum. 
Carry appropriate rescue gear and continue to practice safe travel techniques such as only putting one person on a slope at a time."

November,25,2019,"Last week's storm brought the first measurable snow to the La Sal Mountains. There isn't enough coverage for winter recreation and there is currently very little threat for avalanches. That will likely change this week with an active pattern ahead. Snow depth currently ranges from only a few inches at the Geyser Pass Trailhead to 8"" in Gold Basin, and I'm estimating a foot or more above 11,000'. Avalanche danger will start to become present in some areas when we see about 18"" of snow on the ground. I'll be updating the forecast regularly this week, and will begin issuing danger ratings when conditions warrant. Expect the danger to rise over the next several days."
November,22,2019,"A much-needed storm system over the past few days brought the first measurable snow to the mountains but totals are vague at this time. Geyser Pass Trailhead Snotel (9600') received about 1.5"" of water since Tuesday night. Snow levels were initially above 10,000' but dropped sometime Wednesday night to near 9000'. I'm estimating 12""-18"" at the upper elevations. 
Prior to this event, all slopes were dry and I don't anticipate significant avalanche problems yet. If you are out bagging peaks, you may find an isolated wind slab at extreme upper elevations. Use caution if you encounter areas with more than about 18"" of snow. 
We are working out a few bugs in our weather stations but will provide links to current snow, wind and temperature data as soon as they are available."

Look for smooth rounded deposits of wind drifted snow on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features primarily on slopes that face NW-NE-SE. With daytime heating, we may some shallow, loose, wet activity in the new snow."
March,25,2017,"Today there is a MODERATE danger for wind slab avalanches in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain. Look for smooth rounded deposits of wind drifted snow on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features. Pay attention to consequences, even a shallow slab could take you for a nasty ride over rocks and cliffs in areas of more radical terrain. Mid and lower elevations offer mostly LOW danger."
March,24,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today and heightened avalanche conditions exist both for wind slab, and storm snow avalanches. In upper elevation, wind exposed terrain, areas of CONSIDERABLE danger may exist on steep slopes facing NE-E-SE that have recent deposits of wind drifted snow. And with daytime heating, there will be an increasing MODERATE danger for loose wet avalanches on steep, sun exposed slopes. Backcountry travelers need to maintain a heightened level of awareness for a variety of avalanche problems today."
March,23,2017,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW this morning but will likely rise to MODERATE by this afternoon. An increase in danger will directly correlate to how much snow we receive today, and how well it bonds to the old snow surface. Backcountry travelers will need to be alert to changing conditions, and be on the lookout for unstable areas of recently deposited, wind drifted snow on the lee sides of ridge crests and terrain features. The danger will be most acute on steep, upper elevation slopes that face N-E-SE"
March,21,2017,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW in the morning and mostly stable snow conditions exist on all aspects. With daytime heating, the danger for wet slide activity will rise to MODERATE, and backcountry travelers need to be alert to signs of instability such as roller balls, pinwheels, or sloppy wet snow up around their boot tops. Follow the sun and get off of exposed aspects if any of these signs are present. There is also an isolated or MODERATE danger for cornice fall. Give cornices a wide berth and stay out from under them, especially as the day heats up. Start early and end early, and as a general rule, plan to be out of avalanche terrain by around noon."

March,15,2017,"With the lack of a solid overnight re-freeze, the danger for loose, wet avalanches is MODERATE today. Get in early and get out early if you are in the mountains today. Look for signs of instability such as roller balls, pinwheels, or sloppy wet snow, and stay off of and out from under steep slopes when these signs are present."
March,14,2017,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW and mostly stable snow conditions exist. But low danger doesn't mean no danger and we still have a few things to consider.
With daytime heating, the potential exists for loose, wet avalanches on steep, sun exposed slopes. If you feel the snow getting wet and sloppy, or if you notice signs of instability such as roller balls or pinwheels, get off of, and out from under steep slopes. 
it may still be possible to trigger an isolated persistent slab avalanche in areas of more extreme, upper elevation, northerly facing terrain. Carefully evaluate individual slopes for smooth hard slabs, and weak, underlying snow if you venture into this type of terrain."

Other concerns include large, overhanging cornices, and the potential for loose wet slide activity on sun exposed slopes as the day heats up."
March,01,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep wind drifted slopes, but all MODERATE ratings are not created equal. On upper elevation slopes facing N-NE-E you may find areas of CONSIDERABLE danger.  Gusty winds, and changing directions have also deposited isolated slabs on the other side of the compass.   Suspect the leeward sides of terrain features such as gully walls and sub ridges, and be wary of steep convexities, and blind break-overs. Avoid steep slopes with smooth rounded deposits of wind drifted snow. There is also a MODERATE danger for triggering a persistent slab avalanche on steep slopes that face W-N-E. Backcountry travelers need to possess excellent stability analysis skills before venturing into steep terrain."
February,28,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep wind drifted slopes. It may also be possible to trigger an avalanche on a buried persistent weak layer. The danger is most prominent on slopes that face the north half of the compass, but with gusty winds in excess of 40 mph, cross loading will be a factor on all aspects at upper elevations.

Time and cold temperatures have helped lock many of these slabs into place, but ominous pillows of wind drifted snow still exist on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features right around tree line and above. Continue to avoid, steep, wind drifted slopes. Pay special attention to heavily featured slopes, or those that have steep convexities or blind break overs. 
Low elevations and more sheltered terrain offer mostly LOW danger."
February,24,2017,"Today there is a MODERATE danger for triggering wind slabs old and new on steep, wind drifted slopes, and a need for heightened avalanche awareness exists. Ominous pillows of wind drifted snow have formed on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features such as sub-ridges and gully walls. The danger will be most pronounced in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain that faces NW-N-E. Avoid steep slopes with fresh wind drifts, and suspect older wind slabs on slopes that have a smooth, rounded appearance, or that have a hollow feel to them."
February,23,2017,"Today there is a MODERATE danger for triggering wind slabs old and new on steep, wind drifted slopes. The danger will be most pronounced in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain.

February,20,2017,"There is a very solid MODERATE avalanche danger in steep, upper elevation, wind exposed terrain where newly formed wind slabs and fresh drifts up to 18"" deep exist on the leeward sides of ridge crests and terrain features. Once triggered, these slabs will be large enough to pack a punch. Suspect any steep slope with recent deposits of wind drifted snow. There is also a MODERATE danger for triggering a storm snow avalanche on all aspects, at upper and mid elevations on slopes steeper than about 35 degrees.

February,18,2017,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW this morning, but will likely rise to MODERATE later today as new snow and wind conspire to form fresh wind slabs in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain. Steep slopes that face W-N-E will be most affected. Be be alert to changing conditions. Suspect smooth, rounded deposits of wind drifted snow and look for signs of instability such as cracking in the snow surface."
February,17,2017,"The snow pack is mostly stable and the avalanche danger is generally LOW.

Otherwise, the avalanche danger is generally LOW."
February,13,2017,"On steep, upper elevation slopes that face NW-NE-E there is a MODERATE danger for triggering a recently formed wind slab or cornice fall avalanche. Stay well back from the edge of cornices and avoid steep, wind drifted slopes. By staying out of the most wind affected areas, you can find mostly LOW danger. 
If the sun pokes out today, there will be a MODERATE danger for loose, wet slide activity on steep, sun exposed slopes."
February,12,2017,"Today there is a MODERATE danger for human triggered avalanches within the new snow on slopes steeper than about 35 degrees. They may present themselves as loose, dry sluffs, or as soft, cohesive slabs. These instabilities should settle out as the day progresses.

February,11,2017,"Today look for an increasing MODERATE danger for newly deposited wind slabs, primarily in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain that faces NW-N-E. Snow totals today will directly influence the degree of danger, and backcountry travelers will need to be alert to changing conditions. Avoid newly deposited wind drifts in steep terrain, and look for signs of instability such as cracking in the snow surface. There is also a MODERATE danger for loose, wet slide activity, primarily at lower elevations. Avoid steep slopes with a wet, or punchy, unsupportable surface."
February,10,2017,"Today there remains a MODERATE danger for wet slide activity on slopes that received significant heating yesterday. Cloud cover today will help keep the threat at bay, but the lack of an overnight refreeze has complicated the issue.

There is also a MODERATE danger for triggering a recently deposited wind slab on upper elevation, northerly aspects."
February,09,2017,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW this morning but will rise to MODERATE later in the day as sunshine and warm temperatures increase the likelihood for loose wet slide activity on sun exposed slopes. Look for sign of instability such as roller balls, or pinwheels and wet, sloppy snow. Stay off of and out from under steep slopes when these signs are present."
February,07,2017,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW this morning but will likely increase to MODERATE later in the day as wind and blowing snow create newly formed wind slabs in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain. Be alert to changing conditions and watch for fresh wind drifts forming on the lee sides of ridge crests and terrain features such as gully walls, sub-ridges, and beneath rock buttresses."
February,06,2017,"Mostly stable snow conditions exist and the avalanche danger is generally LOW. That said, low danger doesn't mean no danger, and there may still be isolated areas of unstable snow where a person could trigger an avalanche. The most likely areas for finding trouble are on steep northerly facing aspects, on upper elevation, wind exposed slopes, and in areas of rocky, more extreme terrain.
A storm is on track to affect the region and changing weather also means changing avalanche conditions. I don't expect much of a change today,  but as snowfall accumulations mount, be on the lookout for fresh wind slabs developing along upper elevation ridge crests and terrain features."
February,05,2017,"An isolated, or MODERATE danger still exist on steep slopes that face NW-N-E right around tree line and above where stiff, shallow wind slabs can be found on the lee sides of ridge crests and terrain features such as gully walls or rock buttresses. Though far from widespread, there also remains a MODERATE danger for triggering a deeper, persistent slab avalanche, primarily on steep, northerly facing aspects where the snow pack is relatively shallow.
