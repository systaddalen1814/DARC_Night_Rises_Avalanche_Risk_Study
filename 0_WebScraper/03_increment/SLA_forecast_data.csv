Month,Day,Year,Danger Message
April,30,2014,"Moderate danger today for lingering wind slabs in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain and also Moderate danger today for wet slides on steep, sun exposed slopes as they become damp with daytime heating by the sun."
April,29,2014,"Expect lingering wind slabs and storm slabs today in steep terrain.  Continually test the new snow as you travel and jump on small, test slopes to see how they respond.  Second, stay off of, and out from underneath, steep sun exposed slopes as they heat up in the sun, especially in the heat of the afternoon."
April,28,2014,"Carefully watch your slope angles today.  Stay off of, and out from underneath, slopes approaching 35 degrees or steeper.  Especially avoid slopes with recent wind deposits."
April,26,2014,"We have not issued any danger ratings because of little information and very changeable conditions.  Watch for instabilities within the new snow by jumping on small, test slopes, digging down with your hands and using a good slope cut before committing to steep slopes."
April,25,2014,"We have not issued any danger ratings because of little information and very changeable conditions.  Watch for instabilities within the new snow by jumping on small, test slopes, digging down with your hands and using a good slope cut before committing to steep slopes."
April,13,2014,The avalanche danger is LOW this morning but may reach MODERATE today with the new snow.  Watch for any fresh drifts and for point releases if the sun pokes out late today.
April,12,2014,"The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE today.  There is a low probability of getting caught in a wet avalanche but the consequences are high.  If you're considering a significant outing in the high country, it may be better to wait until temperatures cool down on Sunday."
April,11,2014,"Avalanche danger starts out Low in the morning but will rise to Considerable in the heat of the afternoon.  Get off of, and out from underneath, all steep slopes after the snow gets wet from sun and warm temperatures by noon or especially in the afternoon.  Also, avoid cornices and areas where glide avalanches occur regularly such as Stairs Gulch and Broads Fork."
April,10,2014,"Start early, and by mid day or when the snow heats up it will be time to change your jersey, and choose another sport for the afternoon.  Head to the ski areas to make more turns, go road or dirt biking, hiking, golfing, rock climbing - the avalanche danger in the backcountry will rise to CONSIDERABLE for WET AVALANCHES.   Human triggered slides are likely on steep slopes of most aspects and elevations as the snow heats up, and natural wet sluffs and wet slabs could occur on steep slopes, engulfing you from above.    Avoid travel on and beneath steep snow covered slopes, especially avoiding confined gullies and terrain traps such as creek beds."
April,09,2014,"With direct sun and skyrocketing temperatures, the danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on and beneath all of the steep sunlit slopes today.  Natural and human triggered wet loose and wet slab avalanches are likely during and just after the heat of the day.  Depending on cloud cover, I'd expect some significant activity today.  Heating will also affect many northerly slopes as well - avoid being in or above terrain traps in steep northerly low to mid-elevation terrain.  A pockety MODERATE danger exists for lingering wind and storm snow avalanches in the northeast to south facing terrain above about 9000'."
April,08,2014,"With direct sun and skyrocketing temperatures, the danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on and beneath all of the steep sunlit slopes today.  Natural and human triggered wet avalanches are likely during and just after the heat of the day.  Also avoid being in or above terrain traps in steep northerly low to mid-elevation terrain. A MODERATE danger exists for lingering storm snow avalanches in the northeast to south facing terrain above about 9000'; and pockety on other aspects..."
April,07,2014,"With sun and daytime heating, the avalanche danger will rapidly rise to MODERATE, and then to CONSIDERABLE for WET AVALANCHES.   Human triggered slides will be possible on steep slopes of almost all aspects and elevations, and natural wet sluffs could occur on the steep, sunny slopes especially south through west facing.   
Finishing your backcountry day early is key - get off of and out from under steep slopes as the snow starts to heat up, especially avoiding long, steep slopes, gullies and terrain traps such as creek beds.
In addition, it is possible to trigger wind drifts and dry sluffs in steep, upper elevation terrain."
April,06,2014,The avalanche danger will remain generally LOW today.  Watch for any wind drifted snow in the upper elevations that may be sensitive.  Be aware of temperatures getting too warm if the sun comes out.
April,05,2014,The avalanche danger is generally LOW this morning.  It may rise to MODERATE during the day if we see any periods of intense snowfall or solar heating.  Get out of confined terrain if you noticed either of these situations occurring.
April,04,2014,"The avalanche danger is mostly Low but you may find some Moderate: 1) on slopes with lingering wind slabs from yesterday's wind along the upper elevation ridges and 2) if we get significant sun warming today, the danger will rise to Moderate for wet sluffs on steep slopes that are getting wet from sun warming."
April,03,2014,"The avalanche danger will rapidly rise MODERATE and even CONSIDERABLE for WET AVALANCHES today â€“ whenever the sun heats the snow.  Both human triggered and natural will be possible on steep slopes of almost all aspects and elevations.   Early starts and early finishes are key - get off of and out from under steep slopes as the snow heats up.
In addition, it is possible to trigger shallow soft wind drifts and dry sluffs on steep, upper elevation slopes, especially those facing north and east."
April,02,2014,"Yesterday's danger started at MODERATE and reached CONSIDERABLE by the afternoon...today's danger will start at CONSIDERABLE and trend toward MODERATE.  I'd expect human triggered avalanches to be probable on many aspects today with soft slabs and longer running loose snow avalanches likely.  Knowing the Wasatch backcountry, I'd be surprised if I didn't hear about a few people taking rides in avalanches today. 
If the sun comes out, all bets are off and both human and natural sluffs and storm snow slides will be all but certain."
April,01,2014,"We have an overall MODERATE danger in the backcountry that may spike at times with periods of heightened wind and precipitation today.  Human triggered wind drifts are possible and most prominent along the mid and upper elevation northerly through easterly aspects. Shallow sluffing of the new snow will be general in nature above about 8500' on all aspects.  
With 7 people caught and carried in various close calls over the past few days alone, you must stay focused and deliberate with your safe travel protocols, communication, and decision making."
