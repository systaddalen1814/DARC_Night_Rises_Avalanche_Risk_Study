April,14,2024,"The overall avalanche danger is LOW this morning but will quickly rise to MODERATE as strong sunshine warms steep aspects facing east, south, and west for Wet Snow. Avalanche activity may involve loose-wet avalanches, wet slab avalanches, cornice fall, and lastly glide avalanches. 


Timing is everything - move off of and out from under steep slopes once the snow becomes wet and unsupportable.

Slide-for-life conditions do exist on some upper-elevation terrain where the snow is hard and frozen."
April,13,2024,"The overall avalanche danger is LOW this morning but quickly rises to MODERATE on steep aspects facing east, south, and west for Wet Snow. Avalanche activity may involve loose-wet snow avalanches and larger wet slabs. Both natural and human-triggered cornice falls are possible. 


Timing is everything - move off of and out from under steep slopes once the snow becomes wet and unsupportable."
April,12,2024,"The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE at low and mid-elevations. Avalanche activity may involve smaller loose-wet snow avalanches and larger wet slabs. Winds should keep the snow surface cool at the upper elevations where there is a LOW danger. Both natural and human-triggered cornice falls are possible.



Timing is everything - move off of steep slopes once the snow becomes wet and unsupportable."
April,11,2024,"The overall avalanche danger is LOW this morning but will rise to MODERATE on the southern end of the compass and some low-elevation northerlies as the day warms up.

Pay attention to changing conditions and avoid being on steep solar aspects if the snow has become wet and unsupportable. Steer clear of being on or under large overhanging cornices, which may break back further than expected and may also trigger an avalanche below."
April,10,2024,"The snowpack is generally stable, and the avalanche danger is overall LOW this morning, with normal caution advised. The two main concerns are isolated pockets of wind-drifted snow in exposed upper-elevation terrain and wet snow on the steep solar slopes.

Most of the drifting will be on north to east to south facing aspects, but terrain channeling may drift snow onto any aspect. These soft slabs should be easy to recognize this morning; avoid any slopes with obvious signs of wind-drifted snow.

Throughout the day, as the winds decrease, the strong sunshine may cause the avalanche danger to rise at all elevations facing east-south-west. In these areas, it could become possible for humans to trigger wet loose snow avalanches."
April,09,2024,"With direct sun and heating, the danger for wet avalanches will rise to MODERATE (or higher) on all steep solar aspects.  
HEADS UP!  Increasing winds along the higher elevations will lead to changing conditions.   Look for a developing MODERATE danger for wind drifted snow avalanches, primarily on steep north to east to south facing terrain."
April,08,2024,"Most terrain has LOW avalanche danger this morning.  Isolated areas of MODERATE avalanche danger, however, exist in the upper elevations for pockets of wind drifted snow.  These pockets of soft slab will be primarily found on steep north to east to south facing terrain. 
The danger for wet avalanches will also rise to MODERATE (or higher) on all steep solar aspects.  Cloud cover will be a wild card across the range - you'll need to watch how the snow is changing under your feet and adjust accordingly."
April,07,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE across all upper-elevation steep terrain for triggering soft slabs of Wind-Drifted Snow. We also have a MODERATE avalanche danger across all mid and upper-elevation terrain for New Snow avalanches. Here, loose-dry and soft slab avalanches failing within the new storm snow are possible.
The wild card is the strong April sunshine. See the Wet Snow description below."
April,06,2024,This morning the avalanche danger is MODERATE and will likely rise to CONSIDERABLE during the afternoon as heavy snowfall and strong winds create unstable avalanche conditions. Loose-dry and soft slab avalanches failing within the new storm snow will be the predominant avalanche problems today.
April,05,2024,The avalanche danger is generally LOW with a MODERATE danger at low elevations with wet-loose avalanches possible due to poor overnight refreezes. The avalanche danger could rise to MODERATE at the mid and upper elevations during the afternoon as gusty winds drift new snow into shallow soft slabs of wind-drifted snow.
April,04,2024,"The danger for wet avalanches will rapidly rise to CONSIDERABLE on all steep east to south to west facing aspects this morning.  With direct sun and skyrocketing temperatures, dangerous wet avalanche conditions can be expected on and below steep solar terrain. Mid and lower elevation shady terrain will also produce wet slides and a MODERATE danger with today's heat and greenhousing.  You may also find some pockets of shallow wind drifted snow along the highest elevation bands today.
Cornices and roof avalanches remain significant objective hazards."
April,03,2024,"The danger for wet avalanches will rapidly rise to CONSIDERABLE on all steep east to south to west facing aspects this morning.  With direct sun and skyrocketing temperatures, dangerous wet avalanche conditions can be expected on and below steep solar terrain. Mid and lower elevation shady terrain will also produce wet slides and a MODERATE danger with today's heat.  
Cornices and roof avalanches are objective hazards for today."
April,02,2024,"This morning, there is MODERATE avalanche danger on all aspects at mid and upper elevations, where triggering a soft slab of wind-drifted snow remains possible.

Throughout the day, the strong sun and warm temperatures will cause the avalanche danger to rise to MODERATE at all elevations facing east, south, and west as the slopes heat up and the snow becomes wet. Dealing with wet snow is a matter of timing, and avoiding being on damp surfaces during the warmest part of the day is the best approach.

Avoid traveling on or underneath corniced ridgelines, as they may collapse due to warming."
April,01,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE in upper elevation terrain, where humans are likely to trigger wind-drifted snow avalanches. The mid-elevation slopes that received generally less wind and snow have a MODERATE danger. Low elevations have a LOW avalanche danger.
Use careful snowpack evaluation and cautious route-finding when you are near or approaching exposed ridgetops or areas where strong winds have transported new snow. If the sun comes out at any point during the day, the snow surface will rapidly heat up, and we could begin seeing small wet-loose avalanches on solar aspects."
March,31,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE in upper elevation terrain where humans are likely to trigger wind-drifted snow avalanches. The avalanche danger is MODERATE in mid elevation terrain and LOW in lower elevation terrain where it will still be possible to trigger avalanches failing within new or wind-drifted snow. 

Today, use careful snowpack evaluation and cautious route finding when you are near or approaching exposed ridge-tops or areas where strong winds have transported new snow.  Avalanches travel in packs, so if you see signs of instability, it is time to back off and choose lower angle terrain."
March,30,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger will start out at MODERATE on all aspects and elevations for new and wind-drifted snow. There is a LOW avalanche danger in lower elevation terrain. The avalanche danger could rise to CONSIDERABLE throughout the day with increased snowfall and wind. 

The travel advice for today is to use careful snowpack evaluation and cautious route finding. Avalanches travel in packs, so if you see signs of instability, it is time to back off and choose lower angle terrain."
March,29,2024,The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all mid and upper-elevation slopes where triggering a soft slab of wind-drifted or new snow is possible. Any avalanche may break down 1-2' deep. The avalanche danger is LOW at low elevations.
March,28,2024,"This morning, there is MODERATE avalanche danger on all aspects at mid and upper elevations, where human-triggered soft slab avalanches are possible.
Throughout the day, the incoming storm may cause avalanche danger to rise to CONSIDERABLE on upper-elevation slopes facing northwest, through north, to east and southeast, where periods of heavy snowfall and strong winds could create dangerous avalanche conditions. The elevated winds will continue to form unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at upper elevations. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within the different layers of new snow from the past week.

During periods of higher snowfall rates (greater than 1"" per hour), avalanches will be easier to trigger. If the snowfall rates spike, the avalanche danger will spike as well. Watch for any signs of instability such as cracking and sluffing."
March,27,2024,"This morning, there is MODERATE avalanche danger on all aspects at mid and upper elevations, where human-triggered soft slab avalanches are possible.
Throughout the day, the strong sunshine will cause avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE at all elevations facing east-south-west, where it will be possible for humans to trigger wet loose snow avalanches that could lead to shallow wet slab avalanches on steep solar aspects. Dealing with a wet snow problem is a matter of timing, and avoiding being on damp surfaces during the warmest part of the day is the best approach."
March,26,2024,"Today, there is a MODERATE avalanche danger on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations where human triggered soft slab avalanches are possible. The avalanche danger is LOW in lower elevation terrain.  

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully today as the likelihood of triggering an avalanche will increase with additional precipitation, wind transport, and any hint of March sun that may create periods of increased instability."
March,25,2024,"There is a MODERATE avalanche danger on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations where human triggered soft slab avalanches are possible. The avalanche danger is LOW in lower elevation terrain.  

Today, avalanches will fail on a density change within the newest snow. During periods of heavy snowfall or wind transporting snow the likelihood of triggering an avalanche will increase."
March,24,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE across all mid and upper-elevation steep terrain for dry-loose (sluffs) and soft slab avalanches that will fail within the new snow (density changes) or at the old/new snow interface. Strong winds have also created fresh soft slabs of wind-drifted snow. Look for and avoid slopes the wind has loaded.   

The wild cards: Thunderstorms and heavy snow showers are forecast today. Remember that even a short period of intense snowfall can instantly spike the avalanche danger. And if, for any reason, we see the sun today, you can guarantee that wet-loose avalanches will happen instantly."
March,23,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW and the snow is generally stable.  Remember that Low danger does not mean No danger.  Even small avalanches can lead to trouble in extreme terrain.  

With a strong storm heading our way, be sure to re-evaluate your plans based on the weather today. Heavy snowfall for a short period can instantly spike the avalanche danger."
March,22,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW and the snow is generally stable.  Remember that Low danger does not mean No danger.  Even small avalanches can lead to trouble in extreme terrain.  
With daytime warming and/or greenhousing, the snow today may become wet, unsupportable, and unstable.  Any wet avalanche may gouge more deeply into unconsolidated wet grains, leading to a much larger avalanche.  You'll need to pay attention to the snow under your feet today."
March,21,2024,"The avalanche danger is currently LOW this morning. However, with a poor overnight refreeze and temperatures expected to climb well into the 40s F, the danger may rise to MODERATE for wet snow avalanches on steep solar aspects and some lower and mid elevation polar aspects during periods of strong sunshine before a weak front moves through the area late this afternoon.
Watch for changing conditions; once the snow becomes wet, unsupportable, and unstable, it's time to move off of these aspects.
Avoid traveling on or underneath corniced ridgelines, as cornices may collapse due to warming. Terrain prone to glide avalanches should also be avoided."
March,20,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, but it will rise to MODERATE for wet snow avalanches on all steep solar (southerly) aspects and some mid and lower-elevation polar (northerly) aspects as the slopes heat up. It's time to move off of these aspects once the snow becomes wet, unsupportable, and unstable.
Avoid traveling on or underneath corniced ridgelines, as cornices may collapse due to warming.
Terrain that is prone to glide avalanches should also be avoided."
March,19,2024,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE for wet snow avalanches on all aspects other than upper-elevation northerly-facing terrain.   It's time to move off of these aspects once the snow becomes wet, unsupportable, and unstable. 



Avoid traveling on or underneath corniced ridgelines as cornices may collapse due to warming."
March,18,2024,"The avalanche danger will again rise to MODERATE for wet avalanches on all steep solar aspects and some lower elevation polar aspects.  Don't overstay your welcome on (or below) terrain once the snow becomes wet, unsupportable, and unstable.  
Cornice-fall and roof-alanches should be on your radar this week."
March,17,2024,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE at all elevations facing east-south-west, where it will be possible for humans to trigger wet loose snow avalanches that could lead to shallow wet slab avalanches on steep solar aspects. All other aspects have a LOW avalanche danger.
Dealing with a wet-snow problem is a matter of timing and avoiding being on damp surfaces during the warmest part of the day is the best approach."
March,16,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE in upper elevation terrain, where it will be possible for humans to trigger wind-drifted snow avalanches near ridgelines and on terrain features lower on the slope.  With strong winds over the last few days, you may find areas of wind-drifted snow below 8,500' that will be sensitive to backcountry travelers and act more like high-elevation terrain.
Outside of the wind zone there is a LOW avalanche danger.  With daytime warming there will be rollerballs, pinwheels, and small point releases potentially leading to shallow wet slab avalanches on solar aspects and the lowest elevation northerly facing terrain."
March,15,2024,"Overall, the avalanche danger is MODERATE at all upper and mid-elevation slopes where periods of heavy snowfall and elevated winds have created heightened avalanche conditions today.
Throughout the day, easterly winds will continue to form unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at all mid and upper-elevation slopes. Outside the wind zone, both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within the different layers of new snow from the past few days. The elevated winds should keep the wet snow at bay, but when the strong sun comes out, there could be some rollerballs, pinwheels, and small point releases.
The avalanche danger is LOW at low elevations.

Easterly winds are unusual for the Wasatch, and with unusual weather patterns come unusual loading patterns. Pay attention to changing or abnormal conditions throughout the day. Making conservative choices isn't a bad idea when there is uncertainty."
March,14,2024,"Overall, the avalanche danger is MODERATE at all upper and mid-elevation slopes where periods of heavy snowfall and elevated winds have created heightened avalanche conditions today.
Throughout the day the increasing winds will continue to form unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within the different layers of new snow from the past few days.

The avalanche danger is LOW at low elevations.

Easterly winds are unusual for the Wasatch, and with unusual weather patterns come unusual loading patterns. Pay attention to rising and changing conditions throughout the day."
March,13,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the mid and upper elevations where human-triggered avalanches involving long-running sluffs and soft slabs of new snow and wind-drifted snow up to a foot thick are possible. The avalanche danger is LOW at low elevations.


The new snow will quickly become more reactive today during any period of heavy snowfall or increase in winds."
March,12,2024,"We start this morning at LOW danger.  Remember, LOW Danger does not mean No Danger.  It may be possible to trigger small avalanches in isolated terrain.
I don't think we'll see enough new snowfall (3-5"") today to pose an problem, but if we see more snow and wind than expected, watch for increasing danger in the new snow in the steeper terrain on all aspects of the higher elevations. Continue to give the yawning cornices a wide berth."
March,11,2024,"Most terrain has LOW avalanche danger. 
Areas of MODERATE, however, exist for pockety hard slabs of wind drifted snow, found primarily in the upper elevations.
Continue to avoid the overhanging cornices adorning the ridgelines."
March,10,2024,"The Avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep upper-elevation slopes for shallow soft or hard slabs of wind-drifted snow.
As the sun warms the snow surface the avalanche danger could rise to MODERATE for shallow wet-loose avalanches. 

You will find a LOW avalanche danger in terrain protected by the sun and wind. This is also where the best riding will be."
March,09,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW on slopes facing northwest through east where normal caution is advised. Here, we have generally safe avalanche conditions, and backcountry travelers should watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features. Remember that the mountains are a wild environment, and mountain travel is inherently dangerous. 
On sunny slopes, the avalanche danger will quickly rise to MODERATE as the strong March sun heats the snow surface, eventually making it unstable. Don't overstay your welcome on steep sunlit slopes today."
March,08,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on wind-drifted slopes at the upper elevations where triggering shallow soft slabs of wind-drifted snow are possible. Also watch for long-running sluffing in the dry new snow in steep northerly-facing terrain. The avalanche danger may rise to MODERATE  on steep, sunny slopes facing southeast through west with sluffing in loose, wet snow. The avalanche danger is LOW on low and mid elevation aspects facing northwest through east.

If you choose to step into bigger terrain, evaluate each slope carefully for wind-drifted snow  and consider the consequences of your terrain choices if you get caught in even a small avalanche."
March,07,2024,"Today, there is a  MODERATE avalanche danger on upper elevation steep terrain for lingering wind-drifted snow avalanches. The avalanche danger is LOW in mid and lower elevation terrain.
You will see dry loose avalanches in steep terrain at all elevations on the shady side of the compass and may see wet snow with daytime warming.

As you step out into bigger terrain evaluate each slope carefully for areas of wind-drifted snow or  thinner places that may have avalanched earlier this season. These steeper locations will be rockier and have a shallower snowpack. They are the places where it would be possible to trigger an avalanche."
March,06,2024,"Today, there is a  MODERATE avalanche danger on mid and upper elevation steep terrain where it will be possible to trigger 1-2' thick soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow. The avalanche danger is LOW in lower elevation terrain.
With an additional 1""-4"" of new snow overnight and more snow forecast today in the Ogden Area Mountains watch for and avoid sluffing of the newest snow in steep terrain, and avoid wet snow with afternoon warming at lower elevations."
March,05,2024,"Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist on many steep wind drifted slopes across the compass. 
You can still trigger pockets of 1-2' thick soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow even along the low elevation bands in exposed terrain.  Keep an eye on the sluffing of the newest lower density snow in steep terrain."
March,04,2024,"A MODERATE avalanche danger exists on many steep wind drifted slopes across the compass.  You can trigger 1-2' thick soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow even along the low and mid-elevation bands in exposed terrain.  Note that many drifts will be found in unusual locations.  Cornices, too, are becoming unruly and may break back well beyond the ridgelines."
March,03,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE  across the mid and upper elevations for wind-drifted snow. Fresh hard or soft wind drifts (slabs) may be found on all aspects, including well down into drainage bottoms which are usually wind-protected. Avalanches could be 1-3 feet deep and large enough to bury a human. Conservative decision-making will be essential today.  

Out of the wind-drifted snow, you will want to assess how the new snow is bonding to the old snow surface. Dry-loose or soft slab avalanches are possible within the new storm snow."
March,02,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE  at the mid and upper elevations on slopes with new and recent slabs of wind-drifted snow. Fresh wind drifts may be found on all aspects, including well down into drainage bottoms which are usually wind-protected. 


As the storm arrives this afternoon, heavy snowfall and strong winds will likely increase the avalanche danger to HIGH."
March,01,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE  the mid and upper elevations on slopes with new and recent slabs of wind-drifted snow. Fresh wind drifts may be found on all aspects, including well-down into drainage bottoms which are usually wind-protected. The avalanche danger is LOW at low elevations.
Stay well back from ridgelines as cornices are large and sensitive, including breaking off naturally.


The avalanche danger will be on the rise through this weekend with strong winds and heavy snowfall arriving by Saturday afternoon."
February,29,2024,"Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger will be found for both lingering and developing soft slabs of wind drifted snow today.  You can still trigger pockety 12"" thick slabs of wind drifted snow in steep terrain and primarily on north to east to south facing slopes.  Cornices have become large and unruly: they are calving naturally and triggering new soft slabs on the slope below.  Give them a wide berth.  
The danger for wet avalanches will rise to MODERATE on all steep sunlit slopes and some low elevation shady slopes today with daytime warming."
February,28,2024,"A MODERATE avalanche danger exists on all freshly wind drifted slopes today.  You can trigger foot thick slabs of wind drifted snow on many aspects, but they will be most pronounced on mid and upper elevation north through east through south facing slopes.  Cornices have become large and unruly: they are calving naturally and triggering new soft slabs on the slope below.  Give them a wide berth.  
Keep an eye on how the sun and rapid warming affects the new snow.  I think we'll be able to skate by today without much wet activity (?), but tomorrow will be a different story."
February,27,2024,"Today, there is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on upper-elevation slopes where you are likely to trigger wind-drifted snow avalanches near ridgelines and terrain features.

The avalanche danger is MODERATE on mid-elevation slopes and LOW at the lowest elevations. 


Strong overnight winds created fresh wind-drifts at upper elevations and new snow may be covering them. These wind-drifts may break above you 1'-2' deep; and can be avoided by choosing terrain out of the wind zone."
February,26,2024,"Today, there is a MODERATE avalanche danger on upper-elevation slopes where it will be possible to trigger wind-drifted snow avalanches near ridgelines and terrain features.

The avalanche danger may rise to MODERATE on other aspects and elevations later this afternoon with the approach of a new storm that is forecast to bring increased wind speeds, new snow and dropping temperatures to the area."
February,25,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE across all upper-elevation terrain for stubborn slabs of wind-drifted snow.

On low and mid-elevation slopes facing southwest through south and southeast, the avalanche danger may rise to MODERATE as the snow surface heats up, potentially leading to small wet-loose avalanches on solar aspects. The remaining aspects have a LOW avalanche danger.


It's crucial to carefully evaluate snow and terrain today, identifying potential hazards, as human-triggered avalanches are possible."
February,24,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE across mid and upper-elevation slopes facing east, southeast, south, southwest, and west where triggering a persistent weak layer avalanche that breaks to a crust with faceted snow 1-3 feet deep is possible. Additionally, there is a MODERATE avalanche danger across all upper-elevation terrain for both hard or soft slabs of wind-drifted snow.

On slopes facing southwest through south and southeast, the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE as the snow surface heats up, potentially leading to small wet-loose avalanches on solar aspects. On mid and upper-elevation slopes facing southeast, any wet avalanches may trigger larger slab avalanches, failing on the persistent weak layer (PWL). The remaining aspects have a LOW avalanche danger.


It's crucial to carefully evaluate snow and terrain today, identifying potential hazards, as human-triggered avalanches are possible."
February,23,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on mid and upper elevation slopes facing east and southeast for avalanches failing in a persistent weak layer buried 2-3' deep. There is a MODERATE danger on slopes facing west through south and southeast for wet snow avalanches.
The avalanche danger is MODERATE on wind-loaded slopes facing northwest through northeast at the mid and upper elevations. Low elevation northerly slopes have a LOW danger."
February,22,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across the mid and upper-elevation slopes that face east, southeast, south, southwest, and west, where you can trigger a persistent weak layer avalanche that breaks to a crust with faceted snow 1-3 feet deep. 
We also have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger across all upper-elevation terrain for both hard or soft slabs of wind-drifted snow. Avalanches can fail 1-3 feet deep and hundreds of feet wide. Careful route-finding and conservative decision-making will be essential today."
February,21,2024,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across all mid and upper-elevation steep slopes for both Wind-Drifted Snow and a Persistent Weak Layer avalanche problem. Avalanches can fail 1-3 feet deep and hundreds of feet wide. The avalanche danger is also CONSIDERABLE for Wet-Snow avalanches across the low and mid-elevations. Avoid being in or underneath avalanche paths, as avalanches can travel long distances.
Careful route-finding and conservative decision-making will be essential today."
February,20,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations where you are likely to trigger a wind-drifted snow avalanche near ridgetops and on the leeward side of terrain features. These wind-drifts may be covered over by new snow, will be hard to see, and could break above you.
Mid and low elevation slopes have a MODERATE avalanche danger. There is a thin layer of facets associated with a crust now buried 1'-2' deep. We have been seeing avalanches triggered on this layer primarily on east-southeast and west facing aspects. 




Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today and if in doubt travel on terrain less than 30 ° in steepness."
February,19,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE  at upper elevations where it may be possible to trigger a wind-drifted snow avalanche near ridgetops and on the leeward side of terrain features.
Mid-elevation slopes have a MODERATE danger where we have had reports of avalanches failing on a new/old snow interface that was buried on Valentine's Day.  This storm interface has been associated with a crust in many locations and we have seen avalanches failing 12"" deep on southeast aspects. This avalanche problem is spotty-meaning that a snowpit in one location may not tell you if the slope you want to travel on has this buried layer. Dig on slopes you wish to travel on to determine if this interface is present. 



Sunny skies and filtered clouds could warm the snow surface particularly at lower elevations out of the wind zone, where you could see wet loose avalanche activity on the snow surface. 

Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today and if in doubt choose terrain less than 30 ° in steepness."
February,18,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all slopes across the upper elevations, where strong winds and new snow have created dangerous avalanche conditions The mid-elevation slopes that received generally less wind and snow have a MODERATE danger.

Any avalanches, wind-drifted snow, or new snow may be more sensitive today due to weak grains at the new snow, old snow interface, particularly on aspects with a southeasterly or easterly direction. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today.

If the sun comes out this afternoon, the snow surface could heat up, and we could begin seeing small wet-loose avalanches on solar aspects. Remember, even ""smaller"" slides can be dangerous in high-consequence terrain."
February,17,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on slopes facing west through north through east across the upper elevations, where moderate to strong winds have created sensitive slabs of wind-drifted snow. The mid-elevation slopes that received generally less wind and snow have a MODERATE danger.

The danger will rise to MODERATE on the solar slopes as the new snow heats up. Remember, even ""smaller"" slides can be dangerous in high-consequence terrain. Rollerballs are the first sign that the snow surface is becoming wet, and it might be time to switch aspects.




Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today."
February,16,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations that have soft slabs of recent or fresh wind-drifted snow. Slopes that aren't wind-loaded and slopes at low elevations have a MODERATE danger.
With increasing winds and periods of heavy snowfall possible, the avalanche danger may rise this afternoon, including possible natural avalanches.
Riding conditions will be superb on lower-angled slopes that aren't wind-affected."
February,15,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all mid and upper-elevation steep slopes for triggering soft slabs of Wind-Drifted Snow. We also have a CONSIDERABLE danger for New Snow dry-loose (sluffs), or soft slab avalanches failing within the recent storm snow. Strong winds and heavy snowfall will increase the avalanche danger throughout the day. Cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making will be essential today."
February,14,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE for shallow soft or hard slabs of wind-drifted snow. These drifts may be 6-12 inches deep and up to 100 feet wide. Triggering an avalanche on a persistent weak layer is becoming more and more unlikely. Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully; identify and avoid areas of concern. Human-triggered avalanches are possible today."
February,13,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE at mid and upper elevations where it will be possible to trigger either a wet loose avalanche with solar warming throughout the day; or a wind-drifted snow avalanche near ridgetops. 

The avalanche danger is LOW in the lowest elevation terrain."
February,12,2024,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE for the Ogden area mountains at mid and high elevations in terrain steeper than 30 ° and LOW in the lowest elevation terrain. Slab avalanches may fail in a persistent weak layer up to 3'- 5' deep in isolated rocky terrain features.

Warmer temperatures today may lead to wet-loose avalanches on lower elevation sunny slopes.
Avoid wind-drifted snow along the highest ridgelines."
February,11,2024,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Deadly slab avalanches may fail in a persistent weak layer and be up to 6' deep on upper and mid-elevation slopes facing west through north and southeast. On all other slopes, the main concern is soft slabs of storm snow or wind-drifted snow 2-3' deep. In areas without a cohesive slab, you may trigger long-running loose snow sluffs in steep terrain.
With the sun, the solar aspects may experience pinwheels, roller balls, and small sluffs as the cold snow heats up.
With clearing skies, backcountry riders will continue to encounter elevated avalanche conditions. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Excellent riding conditions exist on lower-angled slopes in all directions."

In any case, the avalanche you trigger is likely a few hundred feet wide and could be 2 to 4 feet deep."
February,06,2024,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE above 8500 feet. Heavy snowfall and strong south winds since yesterday will make human triggered avalanches likely on any wind loaded slope. 

At mid and low elevations, the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Watch for any slope with wind drifted snow, but also the new snow could make some soft slab avalanches."
February,05,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the upper-elevation and MODERATE at the mid-elevations where triggering slabs of wind-drifted or storm snow are likely. Watch for cracking as a sign of instability. Avalanches may run fast and far on slick crusts underneath. 
There is also a possibility of triggering a large and dangerous avalanche, particularly on steep mid and upper-elevation slopes facing west through north and southeast, due to a buried persistent weak layer. If one of these avalanches is triggered, it will break 3-5 feet deep and well over a hundred feet wide.

With clear skies and skyrocketing temps, the danger for wet avalanches will rise to CONSIDERABLE on all steep sunny (as well as low elevation shady) slopes.  Don't overstay your welcome in the oven.  
Last, don't be surprised to trigger new but shallow soft slabs of wind drifted snow in the highest elevations today."
January,28,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully to identify thin, rocky, steep areas where slab avalanches may fail in a persistent weak layer buried 2-5' deep.
 Temperature affected slopes will start off with a LOW danger that will rise to MODERATE throughout the day with warming temperatures. If you start to see wet snow falling off of rocks or trees or are sinking up to your boot tops it's time to get off the slope."
January,27,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all slopes facing northwest through north and east, and mid and upper elevation slopes facing west and southeast. All other slopes have a LOW avalanche danger.

MODERATE danger with a buried persistent weak layer is not a green light nor is it the same as MODERATE danger with another type of avalanche problem. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully to identify thin, rocky, steep areas where slab avalanches may fail in a persistent weak layer buried 2-5' deep. 

With today's warming you may see wet avalanche activity on lower or mid elevation slopes out of the wind zone."
January,26,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on most slopes where soft and hard slab avalanches may fail in a persistent weak layer buried 2-5' deep, particularly in areas with a thinner snowpack. Low-elevation sunny aspects facing west through southeast have a LOW danger."
January,25,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation slopes facing west through north to southeast, and MODERATE on all remaining slopes. Any avalanche triggered within the new snow or wind-drifted snow has the potential to step down 2-5+ feet deep into the weak faceted snow within the snowpack.
There could be a more pronounced danger where the snowpack is shallower or thinner. While it may be possible to find this layering anywhere, the terrain along the periphery is most suspect. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making are essential today."
January,24,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on mid and upper elevation slopes facing west through north through southeast, and low elevation slopes facing northwest through east. There could be a more pronounced danger where the snowpack is shallower or thinner.

January,20,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper and mid-elevation slopes west through southeast and at the lowest elevations northwest through east. The danger is MODERATE on lower and mid-elevation slopes facing west through south and southeast.
While we are seeing less avalanche activity on the buried persistent weak layer, we are still not seeing no avalanche activity and the chances of triggering one of these large avalanches 3-5' deep and a couple of hundred feet wide is more of a risk than I am willing to take.  There is great travel to be had on lower angle (less than 30°) slopes."
January,19,2024,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the upper elevations and lower and mid-elevation slopes facing west through north through southeast. The danger is MODERATE on lower and mid-elevation slopes facing south and southwest. 

Avalanches may be large and destructive failing in a buried persistent weak layer, breaking down 3-5' deep and well over a hundred feet wide.

What to do: Avoid being on, underneath, or next to slopes steeper than 30°. Fortunately, there are plenty of lower-angled options where Wednesday's dense snow has created excellent riding and travel conditions.


With warm temperatures forecast, watch for wet-loose avalanches on steep sunny slopes and at lower elevations."
January,18,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on all upper elevation aspects and mid-elevation aspects facing northwest through north and southeast aspects where new snowfall and elevated winds have created very dangerous avalanche conditions. Any avalanche triggered within the wind-drifted or new snow has the potential to step down 4-6 feet deep into the weak faceted snow within the snowpack, creating a very large and dangerous avalanche.

What to do? Stick to slopes less than a 30-degree today. Stay away from, and avoid slopes connected to, anything steeper than about 30 degrees."
January,17,2024,"While the overall avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on most slopes early this morning, the combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds will cause the avalanche danger to rise to HIGH as the day progresses. Keep a close eye on changing weather conditions, as the avalanche danger will increase with the intensification of the storm. 

Today, there are three avalanche problems to watch for: (1) triggering a slab avalanche 4-6' deep in the weak faceted snow, (2) both soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow that would likely steep down into the weak snow below, and (3) sluffing and soft slab avalanches within the new snow.

What to do? Stick to slopes less than a 30-degree today. Stay away from, and avoid slopes connected to, anything steeper than about 30 degrees."
January,16,2024,"A HIGH DANGER exists on many slopes.   
Today has avalanche accident written all over it. 
Large avalanches may be triggered in many areas.  Travel in or underneath avalanche terrain is not recommended. Remember that avalanches can be triggered at a distance or from the flats well below a slope.  Stepping out of bounds at a ski area is stepping into HIGH DANGER."
January,15,2024,"THE AVALANCHE DANGER IS HIGH.  DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS EXIST.  AVOID BEING ON OR BENEATH STEEP TERRAIN OF ALL ELEVATIONS.

January,13,2024,"THE AVALANCHE DANGER IS HIGH, AND TRAVELING IN AVALANCHE TERRAIN IS NOT RECOMMENDED. DEADLY AND DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS EXIST ACROSS ALL ASPECTS AND ELEVATIONS. 

Later this afternoon, the avalanche danger will likely rise to EXTREME as we expect another storm that will usher in warming temperatures, strong winds, and heavy wet snowfall."
January,12,2024,"Dangerous avalanche conditions exist with a HIGH danger at mid and upper elevations and a CONSIDERABLE danger at lower elevations. Avalanches may fail 2-3' deep and hundreds of feet wide on a widespread persistent weak layer at all elevations.
Do not travel in avalanche terrain - do not be on, underneath, or adjacent to slopes approaching 30° or steeper.



With strong winds and several feet of snow forecast for this weekend, the avalanche danger is expected to increase."
January,11,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and upper elevations as new snowfall and wind-drifted snow continues to add more weight on top of a buried persistent weak layer (PWL). The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at elevations below 8,000'. 

Step off your sled or off the skin track and take note of any wind loading, recent avalanches, cracking, collapsing, and whoomphing as these are all signs that our weak snowpack is overloaded. 
Today is a day to back off of and out from under steep terrain."
January,10,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and high elevations due to recent heavy snowfall and wind-drifted snow which is sitting on top of a buried persistent weak layer (PWL). The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the lowest elevations below 8,000'. If forecasted snow comes through the lowest elevations in the Ogden Area Mountains could rise to HIGH danger by later this evening. 

Today is a day to avoid avalanche terrain."
January,09,2024,"We have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger in the backcountry.  Natural avalanches are possible and human triggered avalanches are likely.  The danger is most pronounced on recently wind drifted slopes.  Know that avalanches may be triggered remotely (at a distance) or from below.  Collapsing and cracking is to be expected.  Most accidents and fatalities occur with a CONSIDERABLE danger.  Conditions will be changing rapidly today.

Remember, if you are stepping out of bounds at a ski area, you are stepping into CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger."
January,08,2024,"A CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists on nearly all steep slopes, even at the low elevations.  You will be able to trigger avalanches 1-2' deep at a distance, even from below.  THESE ARE DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS.  Be careful out there, folks.  Remember, if you area headed out of bounds at a ski area, you are heading into very dangerous terrain!"
January,07,2024,"Update: 9:32 AM: The avalanche danger is HIGH across the upper elevation northerly facing terrain. There is also a CONSIDERABLE danger on low to mid-elevation slopes facing west to north and east. On these aspects and elevations, you'll want to avoid slopes where the wind has drifted the snow, forming either hard or soft slabs over our very weak and faceted snow. Avalanches can easily break 1-2 feet deep and over 100 feet wide. 

Traveling in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. Dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today. Natural avalanches are possible; human avalanches are likely."
January,06,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE across most mid-elevations and on all upper elevations. The two avalanche concerns for today are (1) sensitive soft slabs of wind-drifted snow (2) sluffing (dry-loose avalanches) within the new snow. MODERATE danger means human-triggered avalanches are possible. 
Heads up: If the winds from the south blow harder than forecast the avalanche danger could quickly spike to CONSIDERABLE. Look for and avoid slopes that are being loaded by the wind. Cracking and collapsing are bulls-eye clues to unstable snow."
January,05,2024,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE at the upper elevations and on mid-elevation slopes facing west, north, and east. There is a LOW avalanche danger at low elevations. The two avalanche concerns for today are (1) sluffing in the storm snow, and (2) sensitive soft slabs of storm snow or wind-drifted snow. 
Watch for quickly changing conditions if you encounter wind drifting or during any period of high precipitation intensity.

We have enjoyed a generally low avalanche danger for the past three weeks, but if weather forecasts verify, conditions are going to become dangerous and it's now necessary to develop a mindset of beginning to step back."
January,04,2024,"There is a generally LOW avalanche danger but conditions will be changing. 
Even though we will only see a few inches of new snow today, it will sluff easily in steep terrain.  If you're traveling along the ridgelines this afternoon, watch for very shallow, very soft, very sensitive soft slabs.  Today's a day to get locked in toward an avalanche mindset.  Conditions will start to get tricky and dangerous soon."
January,03,2024,"There is a generally LOW avalanche danger in the backcountry.  
It will be possible to trigger shallow loose dry sluffs in steep northerly terrain.  Also keep an eye on blowing and drifting snow along the most exposed ridgelines where you may find new shallow soft slabs."
January,02,2024,"Today there is a LOW avalanche danger where natural and human triggered avalanches are unlikely except in isolated areas or extreme terrain.

The big news is that we are looking at a weather pattern change and a chance of snow later this week, which could mean changing avalanche conditions."

December,31,2024,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on upper slopes facing northwest through north and east and CONSIDERABLE on the remaining upper-elevation and all mid-elevation slopes. New snowfall and strong winds have created very dangerous conditions. Avalanches triggered in wind-drifted or new snow could step down 1-4 feet into weak-faceted snow, resulting in large, dangerous, and potentially deadly slides. Both natural and human-triggered avalanches are likely.
With clear skies, backcountry riders may be tempted by the appealing conditions, but avalanche danger remains high. Most avalanche accidents and fatalities occur after peak instability. Fortunately, avalanche terrain can be easily avoided. Excellent riding can be found on lower-angled slopes.
What to do today:


Stick to slopes less than 30 degrees.
Stay well away from slopes connected to or below anything steeper than 30 degrees."

December,10,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW, meaning avalanches are unlikely but not impossible today. Recent snowfall and strong winds may have formed isolated wind slabs near ridgelines, which could fail on buried facets in wind-loaded terrain. Pay attention to areas with additional wind or snow.
Carefully assess snow and terrain in wind-loaded areas and avoid thin snowpack zones where buried obstacles may be just below the surface."
December,09,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW. With a trace of new snowfall and multiple days of elevated wind speeds, carefully evaluate snow and terrain in areas where wind-transported snow could accumulate, potentially forming wind slabs near ridgelines that may fail on a buried layer of facets. Avoid thinner snowpack areas, where buried obstacles could lurk just beneath the surface."
December,08,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW.  With increased wind speeds last night and continuing through the day, evaluate snow and terrain carefully in locations where wind transported snow could accumulate and create wind slabs near ridgelines that may fail on a buried layer of facets. Stay away from thinner areas where you may find buried objects just under the snow surface."
December,07,2024,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  There may be isolated areas where you could trigger a  small wind slab avalanche failing on a buried layer of facets.

Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features, and avoid thinner areas where you may find buried objects just under the snow surface."
December,06,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW and normal caution is advised. On northerly-facing slopes at the upper elevations, triggering an avalanche 1–2 feet deep on our PWL (persistent weak layer) is unlikely but not impossible. 

Take advantage of the beautiful weather to practice your companion rescue (beacon/probe/shoveling) techniques."
December,05,2024,"Overall, the avalanche danger is generally LOW, and normal caution is advised. Triggering an avalanche 1–2 feet deep on our PWL (persistent weak layer) is unlikely but not impossible. In more wind-protected areas, small wet or dry sluffs may be expected in isolated spots or extreme terrain.

Continue practicing safe travel habits: expose only one person at a time to avalanche terrain, have someone observe from a safe location, and avoid traveling above or below other parties."
December,04,2024,"The avalanche danger is LOW and the snow is mostly stable.  Triggering an avalanche 1-2' deep failing on our PWL (persistent weak layer) is unlikely but not impossible.  Otherwise, small wet or dry sluffs can by expected in isolated areas or extreme terrain.  
**Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel.**"
December,03,2024,"The danger for wet avalanches may rise to MODERATE today.  When the snow becomes wet and unsupportable, it will be possible to either observe or trigger wet sluffs that can run long distances.  In the upper elevation northwest through east facing slopes, areas of MODERATE danger exist for triggering a soft slab 1-2' deep that fails on a persistent weak layer of sugary, faceted grains."
December,02,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on mid and upper-elevation slopes facing northwest through east. In this terrain, human-triggered avalanches failing on a Persistent Weak Layer 1-2 feet deep and up to 100 feet wide are possible. The most suspect slopes will be ones loaded by the wind.

The best and safest riding conditions will be in wind and sun-sheltered terrain under 30 degrees in slope steepness. Here, you will avoid the avalanche danger by being on a slope less than 30°. And, just as important, you will find soft snow and can avoid hitting rocks while you turn."
December,01,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on slopes facing northwest through north and east at the mid and upper elevations where it may be possible to trigger an avalanche up to 2' deep and 80' wide failing on a persistent weak layer (PWL) of faceted snow. The avalanche danger is LOW on all other aspects and elevations. You may see small isolated wet loose avalanches on southerly facing slopes with daytime heating. 


 I will be avoiding any slope over 30° in steepness if the facets are present in the snowpack."
November,30,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on slopes facing northwest through north and east at the mid and upper elevations where it may be possible to trigger an avalanche up to 2' deep and 80' wide failing on a persistent weak layer of faceted snow near the ground. The avalanche danger is LOW on all other aspects and elevations. 

As our snowpack adjusts to the most recent snow; the in-your-face nature of this problem such as cracking, collapsing, and recent avalanches will be harder to see. Carefully assess where these buried facets may be before ascending or descending a slope greater than 30° in steepness."
November,29,2024,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on slopes facing northwest through north and east at the mid and upper elevations where it is possible to trigger an avalanche up to 2' deep failing on a persistent weak layer of faceted snow down near the ground. There is also a MODERATE danger on all aspects at the upper elevations for shallow wind drifts and small, wet-loose avalanches on southerly aspects."
November,28,2024,"Avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep, northwesterly, northerly, and easterly aspects at mid-elevations and on all aspects at upper elevations, which have received the highest snow totals and strongest winds, in combination with weak, faceted snow near the ground.
Human-triggered avalanches 1–3 feet deep remain possible today. Avalanches may fail within the wind-drifted snow or step down more deeply into the persistent weak layer. Be mindful of cracking and collapsing, as these are clear signs of instability.
Outside the wind zone, the new snow may still be reactive, with small avalanches capable of moving quickly and traveling farther than expected. Today, it’s very important to identify features of concern and evaluate both terrain and snow carefully. It's still early season with a shallow snowpack, and even a small avalanche may not bury you but could sweep you through consequential terrain."
November,27,2024,"Avalanche danger is generally MODERATE across most of the forecast region, with localized areas of CONSIDERABLE danger on steep, wind-drifted northwesterly, northerly, and easterly aspects at upper elevations that have received the highest snow totals and strongest winds.
Cracking and collapsing are critical signs of instability and should not be ignored today. Human-triggered avalanches 1–3 feet deep are likely, with some natural avalanches possible as winds remain elevated throughout the day. Outside the wind zone, the new snow may still be reactive, with small avalanches capable of moving fast and traveling farther than expected.


Remember, early-season conditions make injuries more likely if caught in an avalanche of any size."
November,26,2024,"The avalanche danger may reach CONSIDERABLE today in the upper elevations, particularly on steep north to easterly facing aspects. Human triggered avalanches are likely, particularly in areas that see the most snow and wind.  Avalanches may fail within the new storm snow and they may also fail in the old faceted snow. A MODERATE danger exists on other northwest to easterly facing aspects on slopes that had pre-existing snow.  
Remember that cracking and collapsing are not to be ignored: they are key clues to instability.  Remember also that some avalanches can be triggered at a distance, even from below. 
Extra Caution should be advised with today's changing conditions."
November,25,2024,"The primary hazard in the Ogden mountains is hitting buried rocks, stumps, and deadfall.  
As always, risk is inherent in mountain travel and isolated avalanche concerns of loose snow sluffs and isolated soft slabs of wind blown snow may be encountered.  Normal Caution is advised.

Welcome to the start of the 2024-2025 winter season!
Currently, the greatest backcountry risk is hitting rocks and stumps with our thin/non-existent snowpack. Strong winds on Friday may create pockets of wind-drifted snow along mid and upper elevation ridgelines.


Updates will follow as conditions warrant."
November,12,2024,"Welcome to the start of the 2024-2025 winter season!
High-elevation, shady aspects with lingering old snow present the highest avalanche risk. Any new snow may not bond well to slick crusts or weak, sugary faceted layers, potentially creating sensitive slabs, particularly in steep, wind-drifted terrain. Practice safe travel techniques: travel with a partner and carry essential rescue gear, including a transceiver, probe, and shovel.
Remember the saying: If there’s enough snow to ski or ride, there’s enough snow to slide.
Although burial risk is generally low, the primary danger lies in being swept through consequential terrain. It’s early in the season with limited options for skiing and riding, so please exercise caution.

Thanks everyone for everything!


The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations for Wind-Drifted Snow (wind slabs, soft or hard) avalanches that can break 1-2 feet deep. 


There is also a MODERATE avalanche danger for Wet Snow (wet-loose avalanches) on all aspects and elevations. However, Wet Loose avalanches will be more pronounced on slopes facing east, southeast, south, southwest, and west as the sun quickly heats the cold, dry snow."
April,22,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the mid and upper elevations for both New Snow and Wind-Drifted Snow avalanche problems. The danger is LOW at low elevations below about 7,000' where it mostly rained.
 I am uncertain about cloud cover and whether the sun will come out today. Direct sun or green housing (warm temps from clouds) could instantly spike the avalanche danger, where the 3-6"" of new dry snow would become wet and slide easily on the slick underlying surfaces."
April,21,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation aspects facing northwest through northeast and southeast where there are fresh soft slabs of wind-drifted snow. The danger is LOW at low and mid elevations.



I am uncertain about snowfall this afternoon and the avalanche danger could quickly rise during any period of heavy snowfall. Be aware that conditions may change rapidly."
April,20,2023,"The snowpack is generally stable and the avalanche danger is LOW. The two main concerns are isolated pockets of wind-drifted snow in exposed terrain at the upper elevations, and sluffing within the few inches of new snow at the surface in steep terrain.


Risk is inherent in mountain travel; getting caught in even a small avalanche could have a detrimental outcome."
April,19,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE across upper elevation terrain facing north through east through southeast for shallow slabs of wind-drifted snow. Be on the lookout for pockets of reactive wind-drifted snow, especially in steep, consequential terrain where even a small avalanche can have a detrimental outcome.
Out of the wind zone, the avalanche danger is LOW."
April,18,2023,"Today, the avalanche danger will start off as LOW and rise to MODERATE for new and wind-drifted snow avalanches.

Your primary concern involves new precipitation that falls throughout the day. Watch for rapidly changing weather conditions and look for red flags such as heavy snowfall, wind loading, and cracking and collapsing in the new snow. If you see any of these red flags then reassess your travel plans and stick to lower angle slopes. Stay off of and out from underneath any steep slopes if there is heavy rain on snow."
April,17,2023,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE on solar aspects and low elevation northerly facing slopes as springtime sun and warm temperatures heat the surface.
The avalanche danger is LOW on upper and mid-elevation north facing slopes that will receive less daytime sun. If the wind does not keep the snow surface cool there is a chance that the avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on solar aspects this afternoon. 


Be prepared to adapt to changing weather and snow conditions. As soon as you or your machine start to trench into the snow it is time to get off of and out from under steep solar aspects."
April,16,2023,"The avalanche danger will quickly rise to MODERATE on slopes facing east, south, and west at all elevations for wet snow avalanches due to the sun and warm temperatures. Both natural and human-triggered avalanches will be possible during the day's heat once the snow becomes wet and unstable.
Other slopes facing the north side of the compass will not heat up as much, and therefore you will find a LOW avalanche danger.  


Slide-for-life conditions (where you cannot arrest after falling) are possible on smooth, hard, and frozen snow surfaces."
April,15,2023,"The avalanche danger is LOW as we generally have safe avalanche conditions. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features. Both natural and human-triggered avalanches are unlikely. 


Slide-for-life conditions (where you are unable to arrest after falling) are possible on smooth, hard, and frozen snow surfaces."
April,14,2023,"The avalanche danger is Low.
The two avalanche problems to watch for are (1) cornices along exposed ridgelines at the mid and upper elevations, and (2) glide avalanches in terrain with glide cracks. You also may find low elevation snowpacks haven't yet had a deeper freeze and there may still be wet, unconsolidated snow underneath a shallow refreeze.



Slide-for-life conditions (where you are unable to arrest after falling) are possible on the smooth and frozen snow surface."
April,13,2023,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger still exist for wet avalanches on many aspects and elevations.  Today's cold front will only mask any wet unconsolidated snow below.  I will admit to a great deal of Uncertainty with today's forecast, but I would continue to avoid steep terrain until we see a few days with a proper refreeze.   
Cornices and roof-alanches present a real danger today.  Glide avalanches remain very likely in steep terrain with glide cracks."
April,12,2023,"A HIGH avalanche danger exists on all aspects and elevations.  These are dangerous conditions. 
Naturally occurring wet loose, wet slab, and glide avalanches are expected again today.  Avalanches will run long distances - even areas where there is currently little to no snow, such as trailheads or onto spring hiking trails.   Avoid being on or beneath steep terrain. 
Cornices and roof-alanches present a real danger today as well."
April,11,2023,"Today, there will be a HIGH avalanche danger for wet avalanches. Avalanches will continue to happen naturally, and the debris will run far and stack up deep. Wet slab avalanches have the potential to be 2-5' deep and hundreds of feet wide running into areas where there is currently little to no snow, such as trailheads and onto spring hiking trails.

You will find a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on upper elevation north facing slopes where there is a chance for large cornices to fail, or glide cracks to release and trigger a deeper longer running avalanche.





Avoidance is key. Plan ahead for early exits and avoid being on or under sun warmed slopes."
April,10,2023,"There will be a HIGH avalanche danger for wet avalanches. Avalanches will happen naturally today, and the debris can stack up very deep and run far especially in terrain traps like gullies. 
You will find a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on upper elevation north facing slopes where there is a chance for large cornices to fail, or glide cracks to release and trigger a deeper longer running avalanche.


Plan ahead for early exits and avoid being on or under sun warmed slopes. These avalanches could be 2-5' deep and hundreds of feet wide. If you are sinking through the top 6-8"" of the snowpack you're late, and it's time to exit the mountains and avoid any avalanche run-out zones."
April,09,2023,"There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for wet avalanches on almost all aspects and elevations. Avalanches will happen naturally today, and the debris can stack up very deep, especially in terrain traps like gullies. It's possible with enough sunshine today that the avalanche danger could spike to HIGH for wet snow avalanches.
You will find a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on all upper elevation slopes for Cornice Fall. Stay well back from corniced ridgelines and avoid traveling on slopes with large, overhanging cornices above. 

With so much snow, watch for roof avalanches, especially as the day heats up."
April,08,2023,"There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for wet avalanches on all sunny slopes facing southeast through west. There is also a MODERATE danger for wet avalanches on low elevation northerly facing terrain. On the shady side of the mountain, you will find a MODERATE avalanche danger on slopes facing northwest through north and east for wind-drifted snow avalanches.
Cornices also present an avalanche hazard: stay well back from corniced ridgelines and avoid traveling on slopes with large, overhanging cornices above. 

With so much snow, watch out for roof avalanches, especially as the day heats up."
April,07,2023,"There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for wet avalanches on sunny slopes facing southeast through west. There is a MODERATE danger on slopes facing northwest through north and east, especially on any wind-loaded slopes.
Cornices also present an avalanche hazard: stay well-back from corniced-ridgelines and avoid traveling on slopes with large, overhanging cornices above. 

With so much snow, watch out for roof avalanches especially as the day heats up."
April,06,2023,"Today will be a shock to the snowpack as this will be the first real day of strong sunshine. Wet avalanches are likely on south and west facing slopes where the avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE.
Even though there is barely a breath of wind this morning, I still wouldn't trust wind loaded slopes at upper elevations which also have a CONSIDERABLE danger.

North and east facing slopes should have dry snow today and a MODERATE avalanche danger for soft slab avalanches in the new snow.


With so much snow watch out for roof avalanches especially as the day heats up."
April,05,2023,"Expect the unexpected. The avalanche danger remains HIGH on all aspects and elevations today. Soft slab avalanches in the new snow are running farther and faster and breaking over wider areas than normal. These are unprecedented conditions. 

Avalanches will happen in the foothills not just at higher elevations.


With so much snow, also watch out for roof avalanches near structures, and be extra cautious near tree wells or any feature where you could fall head first and be unable to get out."
April,04,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH.  Very dangerous avalanche conditions exist.  Natural and human triggered avalanches are very likely.
Avoid all avalanche terrain. This includes underneath steep terrain.  Avalanches will run fast and far today."
April,03,2023,"The avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE with today's heavy snowfall.  During periods of high snowfall rates, natural avalanches will be possible; human triggered avalanches will be likely.  Don't underestimate activity in the low elevation bands.  Anticipate changing conditions and a rising danger today.  


Cornices are not to be trifled with.  Give them a wide berth.  
Soft snow and good turns can be found on slopes under 30 degrees."
April,02,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE in  upper elevation terrain due to multiple days of strong winds that have transported recent storm snow into stiff drifts on the leeward side of the mountains. Avalanches may break 1-3' feet deep and 100-200'  feet wide.  The avalanche danger is MODERATE elsewhere.


Give cornices a wide berth and avoid wind-loaded slopes. Soft snow and good turns can be found on slopes under 30 degrees and out of the wind zone."
April,01,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and upper elevations due to recent heavy snowfall, wind transported snow, and today's forecasted sun and clear skies. Avalanches may break 2-3' feet deep and 100-200'  feet wide.   The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the lowest elevations.


Give yesterday's storm time to settle out and stick to terrain under 30 degrees.  Travel in and below avalanche terrain is not recommended."
March,31,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at the mid and upper elevations due to heavy snowfall and strong winds. Natural avalanches are likely and human-triggered avalanches are very likely. Avalanches may break down into deeper buried layers. The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at low elevations.
Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended. 
Avalanches may run down into valley bottoms as avalanche paths are filled in and smooth."
March,30,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on mid and upper-elevation slopes where new snowfall and days of high winds have created dangerous avalanche conditions. The elevated winds will continue to create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at all mid and upper elevations. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within layers of new snow at all elevations.
Both wind-drifted and new snow avalanches will likely fail 1-2’ deep, but have the potential to fail deeper at the new/old snow interface that is now down 2-5’ in places. For that reason, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today.


Avalanche danger will be on the rise into the evening, and any periods of heavy snowfall throughout the day have the potential to increase the avalanche hazard to HIGH if peak snowfall intensities pan out or the weather moves in earlier than forecast."
March,29,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep upper elevation slopes facing northwest to east to southeast where strong winds and recent storm snow have created unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow. A MODERATE danger exists for triggering both loose dry and soft slab avalanches on the remaining upper elevation aspects and all mid-elevation slopes. 
Both wind-drifted and new snow avalanches will likely fail 1-2’ deep, but have the potential to fail deeper at the new/old snow interface that is now down 2-5’ in places. For that reason, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today. 
With the high winds and warm temperatures, natural cornice fall will be likely today. Give cornices, and slopes below cornices a wide berth."
March,28,2023,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exist on steep wind drifted slopes.  This danger will be most pronounced on upper elevation northwest to east to southeast facing terrain.  A MODERATE danger exists for triggering soft slab avalanches 1-2' deep on all other aspects and elevations.  More sluffing can also be expected in the new snow in steep terrain.  Lastly, natural cornice fall and roof-alanches are likely today.  
Pay close attention to the sun and warming temperatures.  The wet avalanche danger may rapidly increase today on all solar aspects and even low elevation northerly slopes."
March,27,2023,"A HIGH AVALANCHE DANGER currently exists in the Ogden area mountains.  Natural and human triggered avalanches in the new snow are very likely in steep terrain of all aspects.  The danger will probably peak this morning.
Heavy snowfall and strong winds over the past few days have created a layered and conditionally unstable snowpack.  Caution is essential today on all aspects and elevations."
March,26,2023,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across all aspects and elevations where human-triggered avalanches are likely. Heavy snowfall and strong winds over the past few days have created a layered and unstable snowpack. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential today."
March,25,2023,"We have had 2-4' of snow since Monday. This new snow combined with winds picking up from a westerly direction has created an unstable snowpack and the avalanche danger is HIGH on upper elevation slopes where wind-drifted and new snow soft slab avalanches 1-3' deep and 100-150' wide are likely. Travel in avalanche terrain is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Mid and low-elevation slopes have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger where careful snowpack evaluation and terrain selection will lead you directly to safer terrain and soft snow. Avoid steep slopes if you see signs of cracking or collapsing in the new snow. 

There is plenty of great riding to be had on slopes under 30 degrees and not below or attached to steep terrain."
March,24,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH in upper elevation terrain where natural wind-drifted and new snow slab avalanches are likely and human triggered avalanches are very likely. The danger is CONSIDERABLE in mid elevation terrain, and low-elevation slopes have a MODERATE avalanche danger where there has been less snow and lighter winds. 
Assessing changing conditions within the new and wind-drifted snow could mean the difference between a great day in the mountains and a close call. Luckily, lower angle storm skiing will be great all day long!"
March,23,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all upper-elevation slopes and mid-elevation slopes facing northwest, through east, through southeast where heavy snowfall and strong winds have created dangerous avalanche conditions. Any bump in winds will continue to form unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow on all upper-elevation slopes and mid-elevation lee-ward facing slopes. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within the different layers of new snow from the past few days.
Watch for any signs of instability within the new snow and wind-drifted snow such as cracking, collapsing and sluffing."
March,22,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at all upper and mid-elevation slopes where periods of heavy snowfall and strong winds will create dangerous avalanche conditions today. The high winds will continue to form unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at all mid and upper elevations. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within the different layers of new snow from the past few days.
During any periods of higher snowfall rates (greater than 1"" per hour), avalanches will be easier to trigger. If the snowfall rates spike the avalanche danger is going to spike as well. Watch for any signs of instability such as cracking and sluffing."
March,21,2023,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE AVALANCHE DANGER exist on steep wind loaded slopes in the upper elevations.  A MODERATE danger comprises all other aspects and elevations.
You will be able to trigger both loose dry and soft slab avalanches in steep terrain today.  Do not discount the possibility of triggering avalanches well off the ridgelines or on mid-slope breakovers, particularly on some east to south to west facing aspects.  
Don't let powder fever get to you today.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear of a close call today."
March,20,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE in the mid and upper elevations. 
You'll be able to trigger loose dry new snow avalanches as well as lingering and developing slabs of wind drifted snow in steep terrain.  New snow avalanches are particularly sensitive during any periods of high and sustained rates of snowfall.  
***The winds are expected to pick up in the late afternoon - watch for an increasing avalanche danger with changing conditions."
March,19,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the upper elevations on aspects facing northwest through northeast and southeast where you can trigger avalanches in recent and fresh slabs of wind-drifted snow. Watch for cracking as a sign of unstable conditions. The danger is LOW elsewhere.
Also watch for loose, wet avalanches if the snow surface becomes damp from warmer temperatures.


With heavy snowfall forecast beginning tonight, expect a rising avalanche danger on Monday and into this week."
March,18,2023,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW with areas of MODERATE at the upper elevations where you can trigger avalanches failing in dense slabs of recent storm snow and wind-drifted snow. 

Sunshine today will increase the risk of wet, loose avalanches on steep slopes facing southeast through west.


Roof-a-lanches are a hazard this season in our mountain communities. Do not let children play in the snow underneath steep roofs loaded with snow."
March,17,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the mid and upper elevations where you can trigger avalanches failing in dense slabs of recent storm snow and wind-drifted snow. These wind drifts may allow you to get well onto a slope before fracturing.

Today's strong sunshine will increase the risk of wet, loose avalanches on steep slopes facing southeast through west.


Roof-a-lanches in our mountain communities are a hazard this season. Do not let children play in the snow underneath steep roofs loaded with snow."
March,16,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at all upper slopes where heavy snowfall and strong winds have created dangerous avalanche conditions. Freshly formed wind drifts, and both soft slab and dry loose avalanches within the new snow are the main avalanche problems today. The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all mid and lower-elevation slopes that received overall less snowfall, and generally more rain. 
Practice safe travel techniques, exposing only one person at a time, and choosing low-angle terrain with nothing steep above.


With multiple days of strong winds, and recent rainfall cornices and roof avalanches will remain a concern today."
March,15,2023,"The overall avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE but may spike to HIGH during periods of heavy snowfall this morning. High winds, warm temperatures, and heavy precipitation have created dangerous avalanche conditions on all aspects and elevations. The elevated winds will continue to create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at all mid and upper elevations. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within layers of new snow at upper and mid elevations, and wet snow at lower elevations. 
With strong winds, and overnight rainfall cornices and roof avalanches will be increasingly dangerous today."
March,14,2023,"A MODERATE avalanche danger exists for developing soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow. These drifts will be most prevalent on west to north to east facing slopes.  Wet loose avalanches will also become a problem with rain to 8000' this afternoon/evening.  Cornices and roof avalanches will be increasingly dangerous.


I expect the avalanche danger to reach HIGH tonight into tomorrow with the storm."
March,13,2023,"Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist in the backcountry. 
You can still trigger lingering soft and hard slabs in isolated terrain, particularly in the mid and upper elevations.  Shallow dry and wet loose snow sluffs may also be expected in typical steep terrain.
Good travel habits save lives.  Make a plan.  Keep an eye on each other. 


The avalanche danger will be on the rise over the next few days in lockstep with this next wet, warm, and windy storm."
March,12,2023,"There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger in the upper elevation zone for wind-drifted snow avalanches that may be 1-3' deep and up to 200' wide. There is a MODERATE avalanche hazard in mid and lower elevation terrain. 


With today's new snow expect to see loose-dry avalanches in steep terrain. There is a possibility that you may find an isolated avalanche breaking on an old/new interface which could be 1-3' deep.  Any hint of sun will rapidly warm the new snow and rocky gully features can be dangerous places if you get caught in a slough that pinballs you down the slope. 


Only expose one rider to a slope at a time and keep an eye on your partners when traveling in terrain steeper than 30 degrees."
March,11,2023,"There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche hazard in mid and upper elevation terrain for wind-drifted snow avalanches that may be 1-3' deep and up to 200' wide. There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche hazard in mid and lower elevation southerly facing terrain for wet snow avalanches and a MODERATE avalanche hazard on low elevation north facing terrain. 


Yesterday's winds created stiff slabs of wind-drifted snow on the leeward side of ridgelines and cross-loaded slopes at mid and upper elevations. Avoid smooth rounded deposits of new snow, and stay off of steep slopes if you experience any cracking or collapsing. Any solar warmed slope has the potential to release wet loose avalanches."
March,10,2023,"Heavy snowfall, high winds, and warm temperatures will cause the avalanche danger to rise to CONSIDERABLE on all aspects and all elevations. The high winds will continue to create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at all mid and upper elevations. Both loose snow and slab avalanches may be possible within layers of new snow from the last two weeks. Dangerous avalanche conditions exist in the backcountry today. 

Pay attention to the rain line at mid and lower elevations. If we see sustainable rain on snow we may begin to see wet activity within the saturated snowpack. If the snow surface has become wet and unconsolidated, it is time to move off of and out from underneath any steep slopes at that elevation band."
March,09,2023,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on all aspects and all elevations. Both hard and soft slab avalanches remain possible within layers of new snow from the last two weeks. Additionally, the elevated winds may create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at mid and upper elevations. 

Avalanche danger will be on the rise as we receive heavy snowfall, high winds, and overall warm temperatures with the incoming storm."
March,08,2023,"Today the danger is MODERATE on all aspects at mid and upper elevations. Hard and soft slab avalanches remain possible within layers of new snow from the last two weeks. These layers are bonding to each other and the likelihood of triggering a slide is going down, but recent avalanche activity is a good reason to remain conservative today.

The danger is LOW at low elevations."
March,07,2023,"A MODERATE avalanche danger exists on all aspects and elevations.  Human triggered avalanches remain possible in the lingering new snow from the weekend. These can be big enough to bury and kill a person.
Evaluate snow and terrain carefully."
March,06,2023,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exist in the mid and upper elevations.  Human triggered avalanches are likely.  Soft slabs and sluffs in the new snow are to be expected and not limited to usual starting zones...
***Cautious route finding and conservative decision making today is essential.***"
March,05,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH across all mid and upper-elevation slopes. Traveling in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. Here natural avalanches are likely, and human-triggered avalanches are very likely.

Remember that avalanches can run long distances, so avoid being on or underneath any avalanche path."
March,04,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation slopes that face northwest, north, northeast, east, and southeast for wind-drifted snow avalanches. Here it is likely to trigger a new or old wind slab that could be 1-2 feet deep.  


Elsewhere, there is a MODERATE avalanche danger where avalanches may fail within the new storm snow or wind-drifted snow 1-2 feet deep. Larger avalanches failing 2-6 feet deep are also possible."
March,03,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE where human-triggered avalanches are possible on all aspects and elevations.


Avalanches may fail within fresh snow or wind-drifted snow, 6-12"" deep, but larger avalanches failing 2-6 feet deep are also possible."
March,02,2023,"The avalanche danger today is MODERATE which means human-triggered avalanches are possible. 


Since the middle of last week, 4-6 feet of snow has fallen. While the snowpack is stabilizing, that is simply a lot of snow. Wind-loaded slopes could have double that amount and could make a very large avalanche."
March,01,2023,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE. New snow, wind-blown snow, and more snow coming today are creating dangerous avalanche conditions.
What worries me the most is that the danger won't seem obvious, and avalanches may be a bit stubborn to trigger. Nonetheless, avalanches have the potential to be large, destructive, and far running."
February,28,2023,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on mid and upper-elevation slopes for new and wind-drifted snow avalanches. Humans are very likely to trigger an avalanche that could be 1-3' deep and up to 200' wide. The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE  in lower elevation terrain where human triggered avalanches are likely.

Today is a day to avoid traveling on or underneath avalanche terrain. There are low-angle slopes where you are sure to find surfy graupel turns and those are the places I would be seeking out today."
February,27,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on  mid and upper-elevation slopes for wind-drifted snow avalanches. Humans are likely to trigger an avalanche that could be 1-3' deep and up to 150' wide. The avalanche danger is MODERATE on lower elevation slopes where human triggered avalanches are possible on density changes within the new snow or on last week's old/new snow interface now buried 2-3' deep.

The potential depth of these avalanches is not something I would mess around with. Today, I would be enjoying the start of a long run of snow storms and traveling and riding on slopes under 30 degrees out of the wind zone."
February,26,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across all upper-elevation steep slopes for wind-drifted snow avalanches (wind slabs). These avalanches are likely to be triggered by a human and could be 1-3 feet deep and up to 150 feet wide.

If you plan to recreate in any low-elevation foothill terrain surrounding the city, please watch this video HERE and know it's possible to trigger an avalanche on a slope steeper than 30 degrees."
February,25,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE across all mid and upper-elevation steep slopes for wind-drifted snow avalanches (wind slabs). These avalanches are likely to be triggered by a human and will be 1-2 feet deep and up to 200 feet wide, and are large enough to catch, carry, bury, and kill a person. 


Wet-loose avalanches are likely on all southerly aspects if today's warming temperatures and strong sunshine cause the snow to become damp, wet, and therefore unstable."
February,24,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the mid and upper elevations and MODERATE at the low elevations on wind-loaded slopes where triggering avalanches up to 2' deep is likely. 
Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making are essential when traveling in avalanche terrain today.



Shallow, wet-loose avalanches are likely on southerly aspects if strong sunshine appears."
February,23,2023,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exist across the compass. Human triggered avalanches are likely.

WITH FORECAST INCREASING WINDS FROM THE NORTHWEST, THE DANGER WILL REACH HIGH IN THE UPPER ELEVATIONS.
Natural and human triggered avalanches will be very likely.  Travel in and underneath steep wind drifted terrain is not recommended today."
February,21,2023,"This morning the overall avalanche danger is rising to MODERATE as the storm develops, but it could rise to CONSIDERABLE during periods of heavy snowfall by early afternoon. Today's new snow may produce soft slab avalanches or long-running sluffs. Additionally, the elevated winds may create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at mid and upper elevations. Pay attention to changing weather patterns, if the storm comes in sooner than anticipated danger will rise sooner than anticipated. 

Human-triggered avalanches are possible. Natural avalanches are unlikely, but possible during periods of heavy snowfall rates or stronger winds."
February,20,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE across all upper elevation terrain for shallow slabs of wind-drifted snow. Be on the lookout for pockets of reactive wind-drifted snow, especially in steep, consequential terrain where even a small avalanche can have a detrimental outcome.

Avalanche danger will be on the rise with the incoming storm, think about shifting the mindset to stepping back over the next few days."
February,19,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE across the upper elevation terrain for wind-drifted snow avalanches. Be on the lookout for pockets of reactive wind-drifted snow, especially in steep, consequential terrain where even a small avalanche can have a disastrous outcome. 
Out of the wind zone, the avalanche danger is LOW, and ""Normal Caution"" is advised."
February,18,2023,"The avalanche danger is LOW on all aspects and elevations. Even though the avalanche danger is LOW I would still be on the lookout for pockets of reactive wind-drifted snow, especially in steep, consequential terrain where even a small avalanche can have a disastrous outcome."
February,17,2023,"The avalanche danger is Low on all aspects and elevations.
Risk is inherent in mountain travel and the two concerns for today are:
1. pockets of reactive wind drifted snow, especially in steep, consequential terrain;
2. small avalanches involving wet snow due to warming."
February,16,2023,"Pockets of MODERATE avalanche danger exist for shallow slabs of wind drifted snow on many aspects and elevations.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  Owing to the yesterday's east winds, look for unusual wind loading patterns.
The danger will trend toward LOW by the afternoon."
February,15,2023,"Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist for pockety soft slabs of wind drifted snow at the mid and upper elevations.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  Owing to the northeast to southeast winds, look for unusual wind loading patterns.
The best bet is finding wind and sun sheltered terrain today."
February,14,2023,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, but areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist at all upper elevations where sensitive slabs of wind-drifted snow will continue to form throughout the day. 
These wind slabs will be generally shallow and small in size. How dangerous they are will be determined by the type of terrain you're in, and above today."
February,13,2023,"Overall, the avalanche danger rating is LOW as we generally have safe avalanche conditions. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features. Natural and human-triggered avalanches are unlikely.
Pay attention to the snow surface on the southerlies. If you start seeing rollerballs or the snow becomes damp and unsupportable, it's time to get out of there or change your aspect to a cooler, more shady slope."

February,11,2023,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation slopes facing west to north and east for wind-drifted snow avalanches. Here it is possible to trigger a hard or soft wind slab 6-18 inches deep and up to 100 feet wide. Human-triggered avalanches are possible. 

If, for any reason, the sun comes through the clouds and the temperatures are warmer than expected and the snow surface becomes wet, we should be thinking of wet snow avalanche issues. This includes north-facing terrain."
February,10,2023,"The avalanche danger is LOW at low and mid elevations and MODERATE on upper elevation, wind-drifted slopes.
Expect small, wet-loose avalanches on steep, sunny slopes as temperatures warm today."
February,09,2023,"Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist on many aspects of the mid and upper elevations.  
You may be able to trigger a soft or hard slab of wind drifted snow in or adjacent to steep terrain today.  Heightened avalanche conditions exist on specific terrain features.  Anticipate slide-for-life conditions on some steep bullet-proof crusts on sunny aspects this morning."
February,08,2023,"The avalanche danger will be on the rise today with new and developing soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow.  Expect a MODERATE avalanche danger in the wind zone of the mid and upper elevations, predominantly on steep north to east to south facing slopes.  Human triggered.... and shallow natural avalanches... will be possible.
Low angle sun and wind sheltered slopes will be the best bet for today."
February,07,2023,"There is a MODERATE danger on upper and mid elevation slopes where human triggered avalanches are possible in the new and wind-drifted snow. These avalanches will be 1-2' deep.  There is a LOW danger on lower elevation terrain where there has been less new snow. 



Human triggered avalanches are POSSIBLE on slopes where the new snow has drifted into a harder slab of dense snow, or on steep slopes where the sun has warmed the surface snow.  A great option is to let the new snow settle out and stick to lower angle objectives where there is good powder-snow riding."
February,06,2023,"Today there is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on upper-elevation slopes for triggering a wind-drifted snow avalanche. There is a MODERATE danger on mid elevation slopes for new-snow avalanches.  There is a LOW danger for new snow avalanches on lower elevation terrain where there has been less snow. 


In the highest elevation terrain riders can expect soft and hard slabs of wind-drifted snow 1-2' deep. Out of the wind zone riders can expect to see loose dry avalanches running on density changes within the storm snow.


These are the types of new snow avalanches that will be very sensitive to riders while ascending and descending. Practice good travel technique and only expose one person to a slope at a time while traveling in avalanche terrain."
February,05,2023,"Today there is MODERATE avalanche danger on all mid and upper-elevation slopes for triggering either a soft or hard slab of wind-drifted snow. Strong southerly winds have created slabs of wind-blown snow. Be on the lookout and avoid areas that have been or are being loaded by the wind.

As the new snow stacks up, the avalanche danger may rise from MODERATE to even CONSIDERABLE depending on the timing of the storm and how fast the snow falls from the sky."
February,04,2023,"Today there is MODERATE avalanche danger on all upper elevation slopes and on slopes facing west through north through east at the mid elevations for triggering either a soft or hard slab of wind-drifted snow. Southerly winds have created sensitive slabs of wind-blown snow that are likely to be 6-12 inches deep and up to 100 feet wide.  

Lose the wind and lose the problem. On slopes where you find soft powder snow unaffected by the wind, you will find better riding conditions and LOW avalanche danger. 


Although unlikely, there is a chance of triggering a slab avalanche 1-2' deep on isolated steep slopes facing west to south to east."
February,03,2023,"Most slopes have a LOW avalanche danger, with a MODERATE danger on upper-elevation slopes facing northwest through north and southeast for triggering fresh soft slabs of wind-drifted snow.

January,30,2023,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevations for wind-drifted surface snow. The avalanche danger is MODERATE for new snow avalanches running on small grained facets now buried 1-2' below the surface at mid and upper elevations.  The avalanche danger is LOW in lower elevation terrain.  Expect to see dry loose avalanches in steep terrain and on any solar warmed slopes.

Cornices continue to grow in size. Avoid traveling below or along corniced ridgelines as they can break further back than you might expect."
January,26,2023,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, but areas of MODERATE danger exist at upper elevations where freshly formed wind drifts are the primary concern.

At lower elevation west-south-southeast aspects where the persistent weak layer is less likely to cause avalanches the avalanche danger is MODERATE.  


Today, natural avalanches are possible and human triggered avalanches are likely. 


This is a day when the avalanche danger is not as obvious as it was even a few days ago. Assess slopes carefully as we have just had a lot of new snow and things are settling out.

January,02,2023,"Dangerous Avalanche Conditions exist. Avoid traveling on or underneath slopes over 30 degrees.


The avalanche danger remains HIGH at the mid and upper elevations.  Natural and human triggered avalanches are likely. On northwest through easterly facing aspects, avalanches may step down into older facets, leading to large and destructive avalanches.  The lowest elevation terrain has a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger.

December,28,2023,"Overall, the avalanche danger is generally LOW, and normal caution exists. Isolated shallow, soft, or hard slabs of wind-drifted snow may exist in exposed terrain at the upper elevations. Soft slabs may exhibit shooting cracks and are typically sensitive to triggers. Meanwhile, hard slabs can be smooth and round, releasing once well onto the slope.
In wind-protected terrain, the possibility of triggering loose sluffs that can catch and carry a skier or rider down the slope remains."
December,27,2023,"Overall, the avalanche danger is generally LOW, and normal caution exists. You may encounter isolated pockets of fresh wind-drifted snow in exposed terrain at the upper elevations.

Natural avalanches are unlikely, while human-triggered avalanches are possible."
December,09,2023,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE at mid and upper elevations. On upper elevation west, north, and east aspects, a persistent weak layer lingers, and I'd give it a little more time before testing these slopes.

Overall the avalanche danger is MODERATE with wet avalanches being the main problem today. These may be wet loose avalanches or they may wet slab avalanches breaking on a buried layer of facets.
March,29,2022,"What a mess of conditions today! Mostly the snow is wet making wet avalanches the main problem today. There is also a buried persistent weak layer in places that hasn't gone away. This layer is likely wet and will remain unstable until it gets totally saturated or refreezes.
The avalanche danger is MODERATE at all elevations and aspects because avalanches remain possible. Wet snow under these conditions is not as predictable as it is when we are under an normal cycle of melting and refreezing. The snow did not refreeze overnight and has a weak layer of facets in some places. Personally, I'd just avoid all avalanche terrain today because there's a lot of risk and uncertainty but little reward."

REMEMBER If you are stepping out of bounds at the ski area, you are stepping into HIGH AVALANCHE DANGER."
January,05,2022,"Heavy snowfall, high winds, and warm temperatures will cause the avalanche danger to rise to HIGH. Pay attention to changing weather - avalanche danger will increase as this storm intensifies.
Natural and human-triggered avalanches are likely. Even unusual avalanches are possible in atypical terrain on atypical aspects and elevations.

Today, there are three avalanche problems to watch for: (1) triggering a slab avalanche 2-8' deep in the weak faceted snow, (2) sluffing and soft slab avalanches within the new snow, and (3) both soft and hard slabs of wind drifted snow that would likely steep down into the weak snow below.


What to do? The only viable strategy today is to ride slopes less than 30 degrees in slope steepness, well out from under, and not connected to slopes steeper than about 30 degrees."

People in the backcountry continue to trigger avalanches on a persistent weak layer formed in mid November. As more wind transports new snow and loads this persistent weak layer the size of the avalanches will only increase.

These avalanches are not to be taken lightly as they will break 1-4' feet deep and up to 300' wide (perhaps wider). These avalanches can be triggered from a distance (remotely) and can travel long distances downhill into the flats.

In these places the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE. While conditions are slowly stabilizing, we still have enough uncertainty that it's worth being conservative today.


Mid-elevations generally had less wind and less snow, but human-triggered avalanches remain possible in the new snow, and the avalanche danger is MODERATE.

A LOW avalanche danger exists at all low elevations, where generally safe avalanche conditions exist."
November,09,2022,"HEADS UP today! There is a lot of dense heavy snow which has doubled the snowpack, and there are many ways for avalanches to break today. There is simply a lot of very heavy new snow containing a lot of water combined with strong south winds blowing for the last 48 hours. At lower elevations, there was rain before temperatures cooled.


I am totally uncertain how the snowpack will react today. What I know for sure is that I would avoid avalanche terrain today. For these reasons today, the avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and upper elevations. Low elevations have a CONSIDERABLE danger.


Skiing and riding was very limited just a few days ago, but this storm has help coverage significantly. Go to low angle terrain less than 30 degrees in steepness with nothing steeper above you to avoid avalanches. With such dense supportable snow underneath and lighter snow falling today, riding conditions will be great."
November,08,2022,"Today the combination of heavy snowfall and very strong winds will create a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger at upper elevations where slabs of wind drifted snow should be easy to trigger. Also watch for fresh wind slabs at middle elevations where the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Triggering an avalanche at low elevations will be unlikely because there just isn't much snow and the danger is LOW.
The challenge today will be finding slopes with enough snow to ride which means going to higher elevations, but few slopes at upper elevations will be untouched by winds."
November,07,2022,"The avalanche danger will be on the rise today with the strong winds and extensive drifting of snow.  Human triggered avalanches are likely in steep wind loaded terrain, most notably in the upper elevations.  
Remember that early season conditions exist: traumatic injury is possible with any avalanche involvement."
November,06,2022,"Heavy snowfall and strong westerly winds have led to unstable snow in steep avalanche prone terrain of the highest elevations.

If the sun decides to show its face today, remember that it's almost May, and it will only take minutes to make the snow unstable on steep, sunlit aspects.   

During the spring, we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Wet loose avalanches, wet slab avalanches, and lastly, glide avalanches.  
2. New snow:  New storm snow instability as soft slab avalanches and loose dry avalanches.  
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind slabs - soft or hard drifts of wind-blown snow."

The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the upper elevations for wind drifted snow avalanches.  The northeast winds are actively drifting snow in the Ogden area.  Look for and avoid steep slopes that have been loaded by the wind.  
Human-triggered avalanches are possible today and could be large enough to bury a human, especially in a terrain trap, like a chute or gully."
April,16,2021,"The avalanche danger is LOW and avalanche conditions are generally safe, with sluffing in the top few inches of storm snow likely on steeper aspects the primary avalanche concern.
Be prepared to adjust plans with any sudden changes in the weather, including wet-loose avalanches if the sun appears or if the storm snow becomes reactive during any period of high precipitation intensity."
April,15,2021,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE at mid and upper elevations where it is possible to trigger a soft slab avalanche in the new snow. Despite generally light winds, there should be some slabs of wind drifted snow at upper elevations that could be triggered as well. At low elevations the danger is LOW.

The danger is generally trending down, but watch if there are any periods of intense snowfall that would cause the danger to rise. Also, evaluate every slope and don't take it for granted that seemingly stable conditions on one slope will mean that another slope is the same."

Watch for isolated pockets of fresh wind drifts on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations as well as wet, loose avalanches on aspects facing east/south/west as well as low and mid-elevation northerly aspects."
April,08,2021,"Today, the avalanche danger is LOW and avalanche conditions are generally safe. That doesn't mean no danger. Windy weather should help keep the snow from heating up too much, but some wet loose avalanches could happen. At upper elevations, watch for isolated slabs of wind drifted snow."
April,07,2021,"Today, the avalanche danger is MODERATE with heightened avalanche conditions on slopes receiving direct sunshine and slopes with wind drifted snow. The new snow will become wet on many slopes and produce wet loose avalanches. Where the snow is shaded and remains dry, look for recently formed soft slabs of wind drifted snow.
At low elevations with less new snow to become wet and produce avalanches, the avalanche danger is LOW."
April,06,2021,"This morning the overall avalanche danger is MODERATE. The strong westerly winds in combination with new snow will create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow. Look for any signs of wind drifted snow, and avoid these slopes. In areas not impacted by the wind, the new snow may produce long-running sluffs.
 Additionally, if the snow surface warms today, avalanches involving wet snow are possible. Have a flexible plan that allows you to quickly respond to changing conditions."
April,05,2021,"Overnight temperatures did not allow for a solid refreeze and this morning mountain temperatures remain warm. Since the snowpack is starting out warm and wet this morning, it won't take much heating or sun for wet avalanches to occur. 
Wet avalanches may be both natural and human triggered and occur on steep east, south, and west aspect where the avalanche danger should quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE this morning. All other slopes have a MODERATE danger and could also see wet snow avalanches especially at the low and mid-elevations. Most of these will be loose wet avalanches, but we could see wet slab avalanches occurring today as well."
April,04,2021,"The avalanche danger will quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE as the strong sunshine and very warm temperatures once again heat the snowpack today. Wet avalanches may be both natural and human-triggered and occur on steep east, south, and west aspects, as well as for northerly aspects, especially at the low and mid-elevations."
April,03,2021,"The avalanche danger will quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE as the snow becomes wet under the strong sunshine and very warm temperatures. Wet avalanches may be both natural and human-triggered and occur on steep east, south, and west aspects, as well as northerly aspects, especially at the low and mid-elevations.
Timing is everything - move off and out from underneath steep slopes once the snow surface becomes wet and unconsolidated.  Today is not the day to be on or underneath steep, sunlit slopes during the heat of the day."
April,02,2021,"The avalanche danger will quickly rise to MODERATE as the snow becomes wet under the strong sunshine and very warm temperatures.

Timing is everything - move off of and out from underneath steep slopes once the snow surface becomes wet and unconsolidated."
April,01,2021,"Welcome to April! Don't expect April Fools' jokes from us, but have fun and watch for wet avalanches today.
The avalanche danger today will rise to MODERATE as temperatures quickly warm and the snow becomes wet. Expect wet loose avalanches which may be human triggered, or they may happen naturally. They will mostly occur on slopes receiving direct sunshine, but watch how much the snow is becoming wet on other slopes where these avalanches could happen as well."
March,31,2021,"The avalanche danger is LOW. By this afternoon there should be some small, wet loose avalanches that occur as the snow warms and surface layers become wet.

On slopes that remain frozen, the greatest threat is falling on the hard snow and being unable to stop.



Continue to maintain safe travel habits; this means exposing one person at a time to avalanche terrain, having someone watch them from a safe location, and not traveling above or below other parties."
March,30,2021,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features. Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel.

Shallow soft slabs of wind drifted snow may be found along upper elevation north-facing terrain features today. Falling in steep terrain and being unable to stop on the hard, refrozen snow surface remains a hazard.

Continue to maintain safe travel habits; this means exposing one person at a time to avalanche terrain, having someone watch them from a safe location, and not traveling above or below other parties."
March,29,2021,"Most terrain has a generally LOW avalanche danger. However, areas of MODERATE danger exist across upper-elevation north-facing terrain for the possibility of triggering a fresh slab of wind drifted snow. These wind slabs will be generally shallow and isolated to terrain features that allow for drifting snow to accumulate.
Always be on the lookout for wind drifted snow in the alpine and in extreme terrain. Think about the terrain you are traveling above today.
 Slide-for-life: Many snow surfaces will be frozen solid this morning - falling in steep terrain and being unable to stop on hard, refrozen snow surface is a definite travel hazard."
March,28,2021,"Today the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE on east, south, and west-facing steep terrain as the snow surface becomes wet.  Look for the obvious signs of wet snow:  Roller-balls and pinwheels cascading down the slope will be the first sign that the snow is becoming wet and unstable, and it's time to get out of there.  

There is also a MODERATE avalanche danger across all upper-elevation steep terrain for the possibility of a small wind slab avalanche.  Always be on the lookout for wind drifted snow in the alpine and in extreme terrain."
March,27,2021,"Today the avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on east, south and west facing terrain as the snow becomes wet. Wet avalanches should happen naturally. Most should be wet loose avalanches but shallow wet slabs are possible. The danger will rise to MODERATE even on north facing slopes if the snow becomes wet.

Go to upper elevation north facing terrain where the snow remains dry; however, be watching for any terrain above where the snow may heat up quicker than you realize. Exposed rocks readily absorb sunshine and quickly heat up the snow around them."
March,26,2021,"The avalanche danger is LOW and avalanche conditions are generally safe.
Watch for isolated slabs of wind drifted snow in exposed, upper elevation terrain and sluffing in storm snow on steeper aspects."
March,25,2021,"Today the avalanche danger is LOW and avalanche conditions are generally safe.
There could be a few isolated slabs of wind drifted snow from yesterday's northeast winds that could produce very small avalanches which would only be an issue in extreme terrain."
March,24,2021,"The avalanche danger this morning is MODERATE at upper elevations as a result of increased northeast winds drifting snow. The danger at mid and lower elevations is LOW; however, look for isolated places at these elevations that can have fresh slabs of wind drifted snow as well. 

The snow on southerly facing slopes shouldn't heat up too much today to cause many wet avalanches, but pay attention to changing conditions and be prepared to alter your plans if you see the snow heating up and becoming wet."
March,23,2021,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE this morning on all aspects at the upper elevations for fresh slabs of wind drifted snow, and human-triggered avalanches are possible.  On slopes that aren't being affected by the wind, we have a LOW avalanche danger where we generally have safe avalanche conditions.

It's spring, and the weather can change rapidly.  Be ready to alter your plans based on changing conditions that you observe in your travels."
March,22,2021,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all upper elevation steep slopes for triggering a new snow soft slab avalanche or a long and fast running dry loose avalanche.  Human-triggered avalanches are possible.  

Keep in mind that if it starts snowing harder than expected or the temperature quickly rises, the avalanche danger can spike rapidly.  Be ready to alter your plans based on changing conditions."
March,21,2021,"Today, the overall avalanche danger is MODERATE. Human-triggered avalanches are possible where soft slabs of new snow combined with fresh wind drifts are the main avalanche problems. 
Low and mid-elevation slopes generally had less wind, but human-triggered avalanches definitely remain possible within the new snow. Heightened avalanche conditions exist on specific terrain features - evaluate the snow and terrain carefully today.

Keep in mind that if it starts snowing harder than expected or the temperature quickly rises the avalanche danger can spike rapidly."
March,20,2021,"This morning the overall avalanche danger is LOW rising to MODERATE as the storm develops. Today's new snow may produce soft slab avalanches or long-running sluffs. Additionally, the elevated winds may create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at mid and upper elevations. 

Pay attention to the changing weather and increased snowfall rates, if the snowfall rates increase the sensitivity of the new snow will increase as well."
March,19,2021,"The avalanche danger is Low this morning but will rise to Moderate as the snowpack warms due to today's strong sun and warm temperatures. Avalanches involving wet snow are possible on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations, as well as low-elevation northerly slopes.  Small wind drifts along upper elevation ridges as well as mid and upper northerly aspects may also be encountered.
The Spring season typically delivers the most rapid changes in weather and avalanche conditions can change quickly. Watch for any sudden changes in the snowpack, such as if it becomes wet and unsupportable or you find sensitive wind drifts."
March,18,2021,"Today the avalanche danger is LOW and avalanches are unlikely. HOWEVER, conditions can change quickly in the spring. Watch for any sudden change in the snowpack especially if it seems to rapidly become very wet and unsupportable. This sudden change means that the likelihood of wet avalanches is increasing."
March,17,2021,"Today the avalanche danger is LOW and avalanche conditions are generally safe. Small, wet loose avalanches may occur as the snow warms and becomes wet.


Even though avalanches today may be small, consider the terrain above and below you and assess the consequences of a slide."
March,16,2021,"Today the avalanche danger is LOW on all aspects and elevations as we generally have safe avalanche conditions.  Remember, LOW danger means we can have small avalanches in isolated areas or in extreme terrain.   


Recall that even a small avalanche can be problematic, especially in very steep and complicated terrain. Think about the terrain you are traveling above today.  If it avalanches, where do you go? What are the consequences?"
March,15,2021,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features. Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel.

Watch for fresh slabs of wind drifted snow. These wind slabs will be generally shallow and isolated to terrain features that allow for drifting snow to accumulate. In sun and wind-sheltered zones, the new snow could lead to shallow soft slab avalanches or minor sluffing on the steepest slopes today.

If the strong March sun does end up coming out today - the avalanche danger could quickly rise to MODERATE on all steep southerly aspects. Pay attention to changing conditions - rollerballs are the first sign that the snow is becoming unstable."

March,12,2021,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features. Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel.

The new snow will likely lead to minor sluffing on the steepest slopes or shallow slabs of wind drifted snow at upper elevations. Falling in steep terrain and being unable to stop on hard, refrozen snow underneath the new snow remains a hazard.

Pay attention to changing conditions, periods of increased snowfall will lead to increased avalanche danger."
March,11,2021,"Overall today, the avalanche danger is LOW and avalanches are unlikely. There could be some sluffing of the new snow especially if snowfall rates increase this afternoon.

Falling in steep terrain and being unable to stop on hard, refrozen snow underneath the new snow remains a hazard."
March,10,2021,"Overall today, the avalanche danger is LOW. Watch for shallow, soft slabs of wind drifted snow that could produce small avalanches underneath upper elevation ridgelines

The greatest hazard is falling in steep terrain and being unable to stop on the hard, refrozen snow underneath this morning's few inches of new snow."
March,09,2021,"The avalanche danger is LOW. This means that human-triggered avalanches are unlikely, but small avalanches in isolated areas are possible. This includes (1) small loose dry avalanches on all aspects and elevations. Slopes that have very slick/icy bed surfaces will be most suspect to loose dry avalanches.  (2) small pockets of fresh wind drifts in open alpine terrain and along exposed ridgelines.

Many surfaces are now frozen solid, and slide-for-life conditions are a definite travel hazard.  If getting into steep exposed terrain, carrying sharp pointy tools would be a good idea.  Ice axe, crampons, and whippets would be useful."
March,08,2021,"The avalanche danger is LOW. This means that human-triggered avalanches are unlikely, but small avalanches in isolated areas are possible. This includes (1) small, loose wet avalanches on aspects facing east, south, and west, as well as low and mid-elevation northerly slopes; (2) small pockets of fresh wind drifts in open alpine terrain and along exposed ridgelines.

Even with a forecasted Low danger rating, continue to maintain safe travel habits in avalanche terrain. This means exposing one person at a time and having someone watch them from a safe location, and not traveling above or below other parties."

On slopes facing north, avalanches are unlikely and the avalanche danger is LOW. Avalanches can still happen but the odds are low."
March,02,2021,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE. On southerly and west-facing slopes, wet avalanches of loose snow will become possible as the snow surface warms and becomes wet. On east and northerly-facing slopes, soft slab avalanches of the new snow 18-24 inches deep are possible.
While unlikely, there remains a chance of triggering a hard slab avalanche on deeply buried persistent weak layers. In many places with a deep snowpack, that is almost impossible while it remains a slight possibility in areas with a thinner snowpack or on slopes that avalanched on this layer already."
March,01,2021,"Today will be a day of rising avalanche danger on the southerly-facing terrain due to the strong March sun and rapidly rising temperatures.

December,16,2021,"Today, we have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on all steep mid and upper elevation slopes facing west through north through east where fresh wind drifts and new snow sit atop of the weak faceted snow. There is a MODERATE danger on southerly upper and mid-elevation slope. Stay off of and out from underneath slopes 30° degrees and steeper at the mid and upper elevations. If you trigger an avalanche, it is likely to break down 2-4' and up to several hundred feet wide.

The remaining aspects and elevations have a LOW danger.


There are two primary avalanche problems to watch for: (1) triggering a slab avalanche 2-4' deep in the weak faceted snow, (2) soft slabs of new or wind drifted snow that would likely steep down into the weak snow below."

December,14,2021,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist on all steep northwest to east-facing slopes at the upper elevations. This terrain is to be avoided.  

You can trigger 1-2' deep avalanches today while on, above, below, or adjacent to steep terrain. 

Sensitive hard and soft wind drifts will continue to develop in steep terrain over the next 24 hours.  Natural avalanches will be possible with extensive wind drifting."

December,12,2021,The danger is expected to rise to CONSIDERABLE as sensitive wind drifts develop in steep terrain over the next 48 hours.  Natural avalanches will be possible with extensive wind drifting.  Any avalanche may step into older weaker layers in the highest elevations resulting in a larger avalanche.
December,11,2021,The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all steep northwest to east facing slopes above about 8000'. Human triggered avalanches are possible in steep terran and it may be possible to trigger avalanches from a distance.
December,10,2021,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper-elevation slopes facing northwest through southeast where avalanches involving shallow pockets of fresh wind drifts are possible. Loose sluffs in the new snow are also possible, espcially during any period of higher precipitation intensity."
December,09,2021,"This morning the overall avalanche danger is LOW rising to MODERATE as the storm develops.
The danger will rise to MODERATE on upper elevation NW, N, NE, and E facing slopes where today’s new snow may produce some long-running sluffs, and possibly some soft slab avalanches where the new snow rests on old, weak faceted snow.

Additionally, the elevated wind may create small unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow at upper elevations.
The avalanche danger will remain LOW at upper elevation slopes facing W through SE, and all mid and lower elevation slopes.


There is still a significant danger of hitting rocks, stumps, and other obstacles. These hazards will hard to see, but they will be easy to hit as they become covered with new snow. Go slow and be careful."
December,08,2021,"For today we have a LOW avalanche danger throughout the mountains of Northern Utah.  A LOW avalanche danger means that we generally have safe avalanche conditions.  Watch for and avoid unstable snow on isolated terrain features.
As always, carry a transceiver, probe, shovel, and have a partner when in the backcountry.  Practice safe travel protocol by only exposing one person at a time to avalanche terrain.   

HEADS UP: Avalanche conditions will be rapidly changing over the next few days, with new snow and increased winds the weak snow sitting on Northerly facing terrain will become an issue. When the snowfall does come, the areas that have enough snow to enjoyably ride will be exactly where the problem is."

December,03,2021,"With storms on tap for next week, we will begin issuing daily avalanche forecasts with danger ratings on Monday, December 6th.  I anticipate the avalanche to rise in lockstep with the storms.  
Keep in mind a few things:
Traumatic injury is likely with early season avalanche involvements.
Carry beacon, shovel, probe, and airbag and travel with a trusted partner."
November,20,2021,"Today, the snowpack is generally stable and avalanches are unlikely. However, with a few inches of new snow and elevated northwesterly winds, shallow new snow avalanches, as well as small slabs of wind drifted snow will be something to watch out for.

A few things to remember:





Triggering any avalanche regardless of its size can produce serious trauma even if it doesn't bury you because the snowpack is so thin. 
Hitting rocks and stumps is a real danger. Don't end your season before it starts with an injury from hitting one of these obstacles.
Early season avalanches are a real possibility. It doesn't matter if you are hiking, hunting, skiing, etc., be prepared with the correct rescue gear and a partner. Many people have died during early season snowstorms.
Ski resorts all have different uphill travel policies. These closed resorts that allow uphill travel can be great places to get in a little skiing especially in you know of a rock-free slope, but it should be treated as backcountry terrain. 


We will be issuing intermittent updates and publishing backcountry observations as they arrive. When we begin regular forecasts, we will begin issuing avalanche danger ratings."
November,19,2021,"With fresh overnight snowfall, and increasing winds expect an elevated avalanche danger Saturday morning. Pay attention to changing conditions, and increased periods of snowfall. Small avalanches within the new snow and wind drifted snow may be possible in upper elevation terrain where old early season snow exists.

November,03,2021,"If there is enough snow to ski or ride, there is more than enough snow to produce an avalanche. The most likely places to trigger a slide will be on upper elevation slopes where a small sluff, or lingering slab of wind drifted snow could avalanche. Right now, the real danger isn't so much being buried but having the avalanche carry you over consequential terrain, causing traumatic injury. It's still very early in the season with limited skiing and riding options.

We will update this as conditions warrant."
April,30,2020,"Regular avalanche forecasts with avalanche danger ratings have ended and we will no longer be updating this page. We will continue to post all observations so please keep submitting them as you get out in the mountains.  

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Wet loose avalanches, wet slab avalanches, and lastly glide avalanches.  
2. New snow:  New storm snow instability as soft slab avalanches as well as loose dry avalanches.  
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind slabs - soft or hard drifts of wind blown snow."
April,23,2020,"Regular avalanche forecasts with avalanche danger ratings have ended. We will continue to post all observations so please keep submitting them as you get out in the mountains.  We will issue updates with any new snow that falls through the end of April. 

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to. 
Lastly - Glide Avalanches. These are an isolated issue and usually occur in areas where the snow rest on smooth rock slabs. The release of a glide avalanche is unpredictable, but it is usually preceded by the opening of a visible glide crack. The main way to avoid these slides is simply avoid being under slopes with a large glide crack."

April,19,2020,"Today is the last regularly scheduled avalanche forecast for the season. We will issue updates with any measurable snowfall through the rest of April but will not issue danger ratings. Thank you to everyone for a great season.






The danger for wet avalanches is MODERATE on steep easterly to south to westerly facing aspects, as well as low and mid-elevation northerly aspects.  Avoid steep terrain when the snow is wet, punchy, and unconsolidated.  Wet, concrete-like debris may pile up deeply in terrain traps and below steep, sustained terrain.
There is a MODERATE hazard for triggering an isolated wind slab on upper elevation northerly aspects, as well as fresh cornice falls."
April,18,2020,I expect the danger for wet avalanches to rise toward CONSIDERABLE today with sun and daytime warming.  Both natural and human triggered wet avalanches will be likely on all aspects but true north.  Areas of MODERATE danger exist for shallow pockets of wind slab and lingering soft slabs from the recent storm.
April,17,2020,"A MODERATE danger exists for human triggered avalanches 8-16"" deep, primarily (but not limited to) along the upper elevation northwest through east facing aspects.  The danger for wet avalanches may rise to CONSIDERABLE today with sunny skies and warming temperatures.  Expect both natural and human triggered slides in wet unstable snow on the solar aspects."
April,16,2020,"This morning the overall avalanche danger is MODERATE at all mid and upper elevations. The strong westerly winds in combination with new snow will create unstable slabs of wind-drifted snow. Look for any signs of wind drifted snow, and avoid these slopes. Additionally, the new snow may produce shallow soft slab avalanches or long-running sluffs. 

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, and pay attention to changing weather patterns."
April,15,2020,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features. Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel.


New snow and increased winds will likely lead to minor sluffing on the steepest slopes and shallow wind drifts along the upper elevation bands today. In areas the high winds have scoured the slopes and exposed the steep frozen surface below, dangerous slide-for-life conditions will exist.

Pay attention to changing conditions, periods of increased snowfall will lead to increased avalanche danger."
April,14,2020,Today avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger is LOW. The greatest hazard is hard icy conditions that would make it difficult to stop if you fell.
April,13,2020,"The avalanche danger is LOW.  Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features.  Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel. 
Minor sluffing is likely on the steepest slopes and isolated pockets of hard wind drifts may be found in odd locations.  Dangerous slide-for-life conditions will exist on many steep frozen slopes."
April,12,2020,The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel.  Very small pockets of hard wind drifts may exist in odd terrain.  Continue to avoid the large cornices along the ridgelines.  Dangerous slide-for-life conditions will exist on many steep frozen slopes.
April,11,2020,"The avalanche danger is LOW, but could possibly rise to MODERATE due to warming of the snowpack.
Wind and cloud cover may slow the softening of the snow surfaces on some slopes, but not others.  Watch how the snow is behaving: if you find sloppy or punchy wet snow, move to low angle terrain or head home."
April,10,2020,"The avalanche danger is LOW, rising to MODERATE during the afternoon due to warming of the snowpack. Concerns for today involve wet avalanches, including loose, wet sluffs and isolated wet slab avalanches. Also, avoid traveling on or underneath large cornices as they can break off naturally. 

Pay attention to rapidly-changing springtime conditions."
April,09,2020,"The avalanche danger is LOW and normal caution is advised. The three things to watch for today are (1) wet avalanches on all aspects as the snow surface warms throughout the day (2) unpredictable large glide avalanches in very specific places and (3) large cornices breaking back farther than expected along the ridgelines.

Pay attention to changing springtime conditions, if the skies clear and the snow surface becomes rapidly damp the avalanche danger could increase to MODERATE on steep solar slopes."
April,08,2020,"Today the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE on all elevations and aspects. As the day heats up wet loose avalanches will become possible on all south, east, west-facing slopes, as well up low and mid-elevation north-facing slopes. On upper elevation, northerly facing slopes with dry snow, triggering a slab of wind drifted snow remains possible.

Avoid travel on or below large cornices as they tend to break farther back than expected."
April,07,2020,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE at all elevations and aspects. On upper elevation, northerly facing slopes with dry snow, triggering slabs of wind drifted snow is possible. On all other slopes, loose wet avalanches will become possible as the snow warms and becomes wet today."
April,06,2020,"The main issue today will be soft slab avalanches of wind drifted snow at upper elevations. Strong south winds blew yesterday and are continuing today. For this reason, the avalanche danger at upper elevations is MODERATE.

The avalanche danger at mid and low elevations is LOW.


HEADS UP - The avalanche danger could rise if any significant amount of rain occurs. The snow is already damp. Rain would make it loose cohesion and cause loose wet avalanches to occur. These slides may not be large but would be a problem in confined terrain like gullies or creek bottoms."
April,05,2020,"The danger is mostly LOW in the Ogden mountains.  Low danger does not mean no danger.  Wet loose avalanches may be possible with daytime warming on all aspects and elevations.  
Cornices should be avoided like the, well...they should be avoided."
April,04,2020,"The danger for wet avalanches will rise to MODERATE on all steep sunlit (east-south-west facing) slopes. Some wet sluffing may occur on the low to mid-elevation shady slopes today as well.  
CORNICES remain problematic and should be avoided, both above and below.  Isolated wind drifts may become sensitive with increasing winds this afternoon."
April,03,2020,"The avalanche danger is Low and normal caution is advised. Watch for (1) cornice falls on upper-elevation aspects facing east with large cornices overhead, (2) wet snow avalanche activity on aspects facing east, through south, and west as the snow surface warms today, and (3) isolated pockets of wind-drifted snow in exposed, upper-elevation terrain. 




Pay attention to changing springtime conditions and evaluate terrain carefully."
April,02,2020,"Most terrain has a generally LOW avalanche danger. However, areas of MODERATE danger exist at all upper elevations for triggering a fresh slab of wind drifted snow. These wind slabs will be generally shallow and isolated to terrain features that allow for drifting snow to accumulate.

Pay attention to changing springtime conditions and evaluate terrain carefully."
April,01,2020,"At the upper elevation northerly-facing slopes a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists for fresh slabs of wind drifted snow up to 3 feet deep. Look for any signs of wind drifted snow, and avoid those slopes.

A MODERATE danger also exists on mid-elevation north-facing slopes where triggering on of these wind-slabs exists and on all elevation solar slopes as another day of warm temperatures and partly cloudy skies will cause wet-loose avalanches to develop during the heat of the day.


The danger is LOW at low elevation north-facing terrain where generally safe avalanche conditions exist."
March,31,2020,"INCREASED WINDS have created dangerous avalanche conditions at upper elevations where the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE. Triggering a slab of wind drifted snow is likely. It remains possible to trigger a soft slab of new snow on slopes without wind drifting.


Triggering one of these slides remains possible at mid elevations where the danger is MODERATE.

The danger is LOW at low elevations where wet avalanches may occur depending on how wet the snow gets."
March,30,2020,"Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger persist primarily along the upper elevations on many aspects.  Human triggered avalanches 12-18"" deep are possible.  Evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify features of concern, and avoid those areas.
If the intense March sun comes out today, you can bet the avalanche danger will instantly spike on steep sunny aspects.  Keep an eye on the cloud cover and if the snow surface is staying dry and cold.  Rollerballs are the first sign of unstable snow.

The best and safest riding remains on the sun and wind-sheltered slopes less than 35° in steepness."
March,29,2020,"Areas of MODERATE danger persist primarily along the upper elevations on many aspects, notably those facing north through east. Human triggered avalanches 1-2' deep are possible.
The best and safest riding remains on sun and wind-sheltered slopes less than 35° in steepness."
March,28,2020,"Areas of MODERATE danger exist at the upper elevations where avalanches 1-2' are possible.  By the afternoon, wet sluffs may be possible on steep sunlit slopes.  
The best and safest riding exists on low angle sun and wind sheltered slopes."
March,27,2020,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the upper elevations where avalanches involving new snow are possible. These avalanches may be triggered remotely, break down 1-2' deep, and over 100' wide.  The safest option is to travel on slopes less steep than 30 degrees.


The wildcard for today is the effect from the sun. If skies remain clear, the danger may rise to MODERATE where you can expect wet avalanche activity on any slope facing southeast through west.



Conditions can change very quickly this time of year, so be prepared to adjust your plans accordingly."
March,26,2020,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations and mid elevations. With so much new snow, there is a lot of uncertainty about how well it is bonded to itself and a conservative approach would be best. 
The danger at low elevations is MODERATE."
March,25,2020,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all upper elevation steep slopes for triggering fresh drifts of windblown snow (wind slabs).  Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making will be essential in this terrain today.  
Out of the wind-loaded terrain, there is a MODERATE danger on all slopes at the mid and upper elevations for triggering a new snow (soft slab) avalanche that fails within the storm snow.  Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully; identify features of concern and avoid those areas.   


Keep in mind that if it starts snowing harder than expected or the sun comes out for any reason the avalanche danger can spike rapidly."
March,24,2020,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation steep slopes facing north, northeast, east, southeast, and south for triggering shallow drifts of windblown snow.  Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and be on the lookout for slopes being loaded by the wind and avoid those areas.  
If we see more snow than expected this afternoon, sluffing is likely in the steeper terrain...and may run naturally during periods of heavy snowfall.


Keep in mind that closed ski resorts are performing no avalanche control work and must be treated as the backcountry."
March,23,2020,"The avalanche danger remains mostly LOW. Low danger does not mean no danger. 
If we see more snow than expected, sluffing is possible in the steeper terrain...and may run naturally during periods of heavy snowfall."
March,22,2020,"This morning most terrain has a generally LOW avalanche danger, but a MODERATE danger will develop for steep solar slopes as small, loose wet avalanches become possible mid-day with peak temperatures. Due to increased winds, small pockets of fresh wind drifts may also be found along the upper elevation north-facing ridgelines.



Evaluate terrain carefully, and pay attention to your aspects and timing.



Additionally, keep in mind that closed ski resorts are performing no avalanche control work and must be treated as the backcountry."
March,21,2020,"The overall avalanche danger is LOW and conditions are generally safe. As the day warms small, loose wet avalanches will be possible on aspects facing east, south, and west, as well as low and mid-elevation northerly slopes.

If the sun comes out the avalanche danger may rise to MODERATE on some steeper solar aspects."
March,20,2020,"The avalanche danger is Low on all aspects and elevations. However, risk is inherent when traveling in avalanche terrain, and things to watch for today include (1) wind-drifted snow at the upper elevations, (2) sluffing on steep aspects, and (3) wet-loose snow due to warming.



Closed ski resorts must be treated as the backcountry."
March,19,2020,Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE at upper elevations where some soft slabs of wind drifted snow could produce avalanches. At mid and low elevations the danger is LOW.
March,18,2020,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all mid and upper elevation steep slopes for triggering shallow slabs of wind drifted snow.  These slabs will be more pronounced on slopes facing northwest, north, and northeast.  However, I would be on the lookout for any steep slope that is being loaded by the wind.

It's spring, and if you find yourself on any steep slope that is saturated and unsupportable to our weight, it's a good idea to turn around as wet snow avalanches could remain a possibility today."
March,17,2020,"The danger for wet avalanches will rise to and perhaps exceed MODERATE with direct sun and daytime heating. Natural and human triggered wet avalanches are possible.
Cornices may also fail naturally and on approach."
March,16,2020,"The danger for wet avalanches will rise to and perhaps exceed MODERATE with direct sun and daytime heating.  Natural and human triggered wet avalanches are possible. 
While most wind drifts have stabilized, some may still be sensitive to human provocation today. Cornices may also fail naturally and on approach."
March,15,2020,"Today, a MODERATE avalanche danger exists on all upper elevation slopes. Wind drifts remain the primary concern and are most pronounced, but not isolated to, steep north to east-facing slopes where triggering both a hard or soft slab is possible. A LOW avalanche danger exists on all mid and low elevations, where generally safe avalanche conditions exist.

With warm temperatures or rain, the avalanche danger may rise to MODERATE on low and mid-elevation steeper slopes mid-day. Good timing and trip planning are important. Consider avalanche runout zones."
March,14,2020,"Most terrain has a generally LOW avalanche danger. However, areas of MODERATE danger do exist at all upper elevations where fresh slabs of wind drifted snow exists. These wind slabs will be generally shallow and isolated to terrain features that allow for drifting snow to accumulate.

Continue to evaluate snow and terrain carefully."
March,13,2020,Today the avalanche danger is LOW at all elevations and aspects. Cloudy skies will limit warming of the snowpack and any wet avalanche problems. Most old slabs of wind drifted snow have stabilized.
March,12,2020,"Today the avalanche danger will start LOW on all aspects and elevations but rise to MODERATE on south, east and west facing slopes as the day heats up. Wet loose avalanches will become possible on these slopes. They may occur on northerly facing slopes at low elevations as well but won't be as likely without direct sunshine on them. Other slopes will keep a LOW danger but there could be old slabs of wind drifted snow in isolated locations that could be triggered."
March,11,2020,"A lot of terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  Areas of MODERATE danger, however, do exist for wind drifts in (but not limited to) the upper elevations.  These will be most pronounced on steep northwest to northeast to south-facing slopes. 
Wet avalanches will be possible with any clearing (strong sun) on the steeper sunlit slopes and lower elevation shady slopes."
March,10,2020,"A lot of terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  Areas of MODERATE danger, however, do exist for pockety wind drifts in (but not limited to) the upper elevations.  These will be most pronounced on steep northwest to northeast to south facing slopes.  Wet avalanches will be possible with any clearing on the steeper sunlit slopes and lower elevation shady slopes."

South facing upper elevations and mid elevations generally had less wind and snow, but human triggered avalanches definitely remain possible, and the avalanche danger is MODERATE. 


At low elevations, the snow fell on bare ground, and the avalanche danger is LOW."
December,19,2020,"Today, with increasing winds and widespread weak faceted snow, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all upper elevation slopes. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended. Stay off of and out from underneath slopes 30° degrees and steeper at the mid and upper elevations. If you trigger an avalanche, it is likely to break down 12-18"" and up to several hundred feet wide.


Low and Mid elevations are less likely to be loaded by the wind and have a MODERATE danger."
December,18,2020,"An Avalanche Warning has been issued and the avalanche danger is HIGH on all aspects at the upper elevations. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended. Stay off of and out from underneath slopes 30° degrees and steeper at the mid and upper elevations. If you trigger an avalanche, it is likely to break down 12-18"" and over a hundred feet wide.
The avalanche danger is Considerable at the mid-elevations, and Moderate at the low elevations."
December,17,2020,"Today will be a day of RISING AVALANCHE DANGER and may even reach HIGH this afternoon with peak winds and snowfall.  

As of now, the danger is CONSIDERABLE on all upper elevation steep wind loaded terrain.  At mid-elevations, the avalanche is MODERATE. Any mid and upper elevation steep slope that harbors weak faceted snow should be approached with great caution.             

Human triggered avalanches 12-18""deep will become likely and may be triggered at a distance.  Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision-making are essential today."
December,16,2020,"Most terrain has LOW danger.  Areas of MODERATE danger, however, exist on some slopes, primarily in the upper elevations.  The danger will be more pronounced on steep northwest to the north to south-east facing slopes.  Human triggered avalanches a foot deep are possible and may be triggered at a distance.  They may also be triggered from below.  Collapsing and cracking are immediate signs of an unstable snowpack."

REMEMBER that getting caught in even a small avalanche could have significant consequences with the risk of hitting a rock, stump, or downed timber."
November,30,2020,"The avalanche danger is LOW and normal caution is advised. Watch for and avoid (1) shallow wind drifts in upper elevation protected terrain, (2) fast running loose-snow avalanches in steep northerly terrain as the surface snow becomes weak and cohesionless, and (3) wet rollerballs, pinwheels, and even wet loose sluffs on the steepest sunlit slopes by midday.

April,30,2019,"Regular avalanche forecasts with avalanche danger ratings have ended. We will continue to post all observations so please keep submitting them as you get out in the mountains.  

During the spring we typically deal with three different avalanche problems: 
1. Wet snow:  Get out early and get home early. Get off of--and out from underneath--any slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper when the snow becomes wet enough to not support your weight. 
2. New snow:  We almost always get several winter-like snow storms in April and May. Treat each storm just like you would in winter. Avalanches can occur within the new snow typically from 1) low density layers deposited during the storm, 2) high precipitation intensity during a storm and 3) when cold, dry snow becomes wet for the first time, it almost always means wet sluffs (loose snow that fans outward as it descends).  This can happen within minutes of direct sun on cold snow. 
3. Wind Drifted Snow:  Wind can rapidly load snow onto steep slopes making those slopes more prone to avalanching.  Wind drifted snow looks rounded and pillowy, in some cases it can sound hollow like a drum.  Be sure to check upper elevation wind sites in the links below to get an idea of what the winds have been up to."
April,21,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the upper elevation northeast through easterly facing terrain for shallow wind drifted snow.  There is also a MODERATE danger for shallow, wet snow sluffs on all steep mid and upper elevation terrain.  The rain snow line will stay between 8,000'-9,000' for the day. 
Any period of strong sunshine can make the new snow unstable in a matter of minutes.  Keep an eye on the new snow to see how wet and heavy it's becoming as it heats throughout the day."
April,20,2019,"Temperatures did not drop below freezing last night and this morning temperatures are very warm. Because the snowpack is starting out warm and wet this morning, it won't take much heating for wet avalanches to occur. Most of these will be loose wet avalanches.

Wet slides are most likely at mid and upper elevation slopes facing E, S, and W where the avalanche danger should quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE this morning. All other slopes have a MODERATE danger.

Trent will update the Salt Lake City, Ogden and Provo forecasts Saturday morning (April 20th) by 7:30 am."
April,19,2019,"With strong sunshine and warm temperatures, the hazard for wet avalanches may rise to Considerable on aspects facing southeast through west, with a Moderate hazard elsewhere. Activity may involve both loose sluffs as well as larger, wet slab avalanches. Wet avalanche activity will begin much earlier than the past two days, possibly by mid-morning.
Mark will update the Salt Lake City, Ogden and Provo forecasts Saturday morning (April 20th) by 7:30 am."
April,18,2019,"Today on East, South, and West facing slopes, the danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE as the snow warms and becomes wet. Northerly facing and shaded slopes will have a MODERATE danger. 


Greg will update the Salt Lake City, Ogden and Provo forecasts Friday morning (April 19th) by 7:30 am."
April,17,2019,"The avalanche danger will rapidly rise from LOW to CONSIDERABLE with sun and daytime heating on steep slopes of almost all aspects and elevations.  Wet snow avalanches will entrain snow as they move down slope, resulting in large piles of cement like debris. As soon as the snow becomes damp, it’s time to get off of and out from under steep slopes.  Avoid travel in avalanche runout zones - below gullies and chutes - where long running natural avalanches could reach even the lower elevations.

April,16,2019,"Dangerous avalanche conditions.  
Only those with excellent snowpack evaluation skills, cautious route finding and conservative decision-making should head into the backcountry today.  
The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all steep, mid and upper elevation slopes - natural avalanches are possible and human triggered slides likely today.  Any slide triggered today will rapidly become a wet snow slide as it moves down slope, resulting in large piles of cement like debris.  The danger is MODERATE for triggering wet snow slides at the lower elevations and for avoiding runout zones, as natural avalanches from above could run long distances in isolated places. 


I will update the Salt Lake City, Ogden and Provo forecast Wednesday morning (April 17th) by 7:30 am."
April,15,2019,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE for Wet Snow avalanches at all mid and upper elevations.  Rain, heavy snow and strong southerly winds have created dangerous avalanche conditions.  Natural avalanches are possible and human triggered slides are likely.  Avoid being on or under any slopes steeper than 30° in slope steepness.  I would not recommend traveling in avalanche terrain today. 

Evelyn Lees will be updating the Salt Lake City, Ogden and Provo forecast Tuesday morning (April 16 th) by 7:30 am."
April,14,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE for wind drifted snow at all upper elevations and at mid elevation northeast through easterly facing terrain.  Strong southerly winds will create dangerous slabs of snow across specific terrain features and human triggered avalanches are possible.  Rain is possible today at the low to mid elevations and there is a MODERATE danger for wet snow avalanches. 
I will be updating the Salt Lake City, Ogden and Provo forecast Monday morning (April 15th) by 7:00 am."
April,13,2019,"The main avalanche problem today will be wet snow avalanches as strong sunshine heats up new snow from this week making the avalanche danger MODERATE on all low elevation slopes and and all mid and upper elevation slopes that face east, south and west.

Better stability and better riding conditions will be found on mid and upper elevation, northerly aspects where dry snow should remain through the day and the danger is LOW.  A small chance remains for dry snow avalanches that will be mostly on slopes with wind drifted snow."
April,12,2019,"The avalanche hazard is generally Low, but there are enough concerns - especially with unpredictable spring weather - that warrant an overall Moderate hazard. The primary avalanche issues include recent storm snow as well as recent and new wind drifts.  Additionally, if the snow surface warms today, avalanches involving wet snow are possible. Have a flexible plan that allows you to quickly respond to changing conditions."
April,11,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep, wind drifted mid and upper elevation slopes, where human triggered slides are possible today.  The danger could rise from LOW to MODERATE for wet loose sluffs if the clouds thin or the sun comes out.  Avoid avalanche runout zones and small terrain traps even at the low elevations. 
Want a great powder day?  Seek wind sheltered slopes early in the day while the snow is cold.  It could be a dynamic day, but with careful snowpack evaluation and constant assessment for heating, there are lots of safer options for touring and riding today."
April,10,2019,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all mid and upper elevation slopes - natural avalanches are possible, and human triggered slides likely.  The danger is MODERATE at the low elevations. Both new snow and wet snow avalanches can be easily triggered. The danger will peak during periods of heavy snowfall or where the winds pick up, and may reach HIGH with a natural avalanche cycle occurring after frontal passage.  
Dangerous avalanche conditions today will require careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision making.  Avoid avalanche run out zones."
April,09,2019,"Another night without a good refreeze.  Today, we'll have areas of Considerable avalanche danger for wet avalanches on many slopes.  They will be most pronounced in the mid and low elevations and particularly on the north to east side of the compass.  High northerly slopes will also be prone to wet sluffing in steeper terrain.  Cornices and glide avalanche-prone slopes are to be avoided.  Lastly, shallow new snow instabilities may spike with periods of heavy snowfall in the late afternoon."
April,08,2019,"The avalanche danger for wet loose and wet slab avalanches will rapidly rise to MODERATE and may reach CONSIDERABLE with today's direct sun and scorching temperatures.  Natural and human triggered avalanches are probable.  When the snow becomes wet and unsupportable, avoid all steep terrain.  Avoid all cornices and glide cracks as each are prone to release today."
April,07,2019,"This morning the avalanche danger is LOW.  However, it will quickly rise to MODERATE with day time heating allowing for wet loose avalanches at all elevations and aspects.  Keep an eye on the snow surface to see if it's becoming wet, damp and loose.  If the snow surface is hard and dry then it will remain a LOW avalanche danger in those locations.  

Persistent Weak Layer - This layer seems to have healed in the Ogden area as there have not been any avalanches related to this layer in the past 12 days.  It was located on mid and upper elevation northwest, north and northeast facing terrain."
April,06,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE. The main issue will be wet avalanches at mid and low elevations where the snowpack was wet and saturated yesterday. The mostly likely avalanches will be wet loose slides at mid and low elevations, but wet slabs will be possible at mid elevations. At upper elevations, shallow avalanches of wind drifted snow will be possible."
April,05,2019,"The avalanche hazard is MODERATE where both wet loose and wet slab avalanches are possible, especially as the day warms. Avalanche activity may be both natural and human-triggered, and occur on all aspects at all elevations. Although wet avalanches may be shallow, they may run long distances and produce deep debris piles."
April,04,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE for triggering wet snow avalanches on all slopes this morning.  The danger may rise to CONSIDERABLE with afternoon heating, with deeper gouging wet loose sluffs and  even wet slabs possible at all elevations.   Avoid drainages and gullies, terrain such as Hells Canyon, where even a shallow slide will run far and result deep, cement like debris piles.   
The avalanche danger is MODERATE for triggering a lingering wind drift on steep, upper elevation northerly facing slopes slopes."
April,03,2019,"The upper elevation steep northwest through easterly facing terrain has a CONSIDERABLE danger for triggering avalanches in wind drifted snow.  In isolated locations, these windslabs could trigger a deeper avalanche failing on a buried persistent weak layer.
Lower and mid elevation terrain has a MODERATE danger, where wet snow avalanches are likely. 
The snow will be more unstable during any periods of heavy rain or snowfall."
April,02,2019,"The mid and upper elevation steep northwest through easterly facing terrain has a MODERATE danger for triggering an avalanche 1-3' deep on one, perhaps two buried persistent weak layers.  
A LOW danger exists on all other slopes.  Normal Caution should be observed. Wet push-alanches possible in terrain that had a poor overnight refreeze. Dry sluffs and pockets of shallow new wind drifts up high.
Follow safe travel protocol, carry and know how to use your rescue gear, and minimize your exposure in high consequence terrain."
April,01,2019,"This morning the avalanche danger is LOW on all east through south through west aspects.  By mid morning and early afternoon the avalanche danger will quickly rise to MODERATE or higher in the steep sunlit terrain and low northerly terrain due to strong sun, warming temperatures, and possible greenhousing.  Human and natural wet loose avalanches will be possible. 

The mid and upper elevation steep northwest through easterly facing terrain has a MODERATE danger for triggering an avalanche 1-3' deep on one, perhaps two buried persistent weak layers."
March,31,2019,"This morning the avalanche danger is LOW on all east through west aspects.

The mid and upper elevation steep northwest through northeast facing terrain has a MODERATE danger for triggering an avalanche 2-3' deep on a buried persistent weak layer."
March,30,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE. The main avalanche problem to watch for and avoid are fresh slabs of wind drifted snow.

As the day warms and if the sun appears for any notable length of time, watch for the snow becoming wet and producing loose wet avalanches."
March,29,2019,"The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE in the upper elevations, and MODERATE at the mid and lower elevations. Today's avalanche problems include sluffing and soft slabs in the new snow, and fresh wind drifts. Both natural and human-triggered avalanches are possible. At the lower elevations loose wet activity is possible. The avalanche hazard may change very quickly during any period of heavy snowfall, wind-drifting, or warming. Watch for rapidly changing conditions, and adjust your plans accordingly."
March,28,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE for wet snow avalanches - both loose sluffs and wet slabs - on all but the upper elevation, northerly facing slopes.  Temperatures will remain above freezing at most elevations until tonight.





The avalanche danger is also MODERATE on steep mid and upper elevation slopes for triggering a slab of wind drifted snow or storm snow,  possibly breaking on surface hoar or facets. These may be triggered at a distance."
March,27,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE for wet avalanches - both loose sluffs and shallow wet slab avalanches are possible in all steep terrain, except for the northerly upper elevations.

March,26,2019,"The avalanche danger rise earlier today to CONSIDERABLE for wet avalanches on all steep sunlit slopes with sun and warming. 
Natural and human triggered wet avalanches are certain on east, then south, then west facing slopes...and even include low and some mid elevation northerly terrain.  Human triggered soft slab avalanches are still possible in the northerly mid and upper elevations.  These may be triggered at a distance."
March,25,2019,"The avalanche danger will rapidly rise to CONSIDERABLE for wet avalanches on all steep sunlit slopes today with sun and warming. 
Natural and human triggered wet loose and wet slab avalanches are certain on east, then south, then west facing slopes...and even include low and some mid elevation northerly terrain.  AVOID BEING ON OR BENEATH STEEP SUNLIT SLOPES BY THE TIME THEY'VE BECOME WET AND UNSTABLE.  Human triggered soft slab avalanches are still possible in the northerly mid and upper elevations."
March,24,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all steep upper elevation slopes, where shallow slabs of new wind drifted snow could fail.  The danger is MORE pronounced on mid and upper elevation slopes facing northwest, north and northeast for an avalanche that breaks 1-2' feet deep on a persistent weak layer.  At the mid and lower elevations there is a MODERATE danger for wet loose avalanches."
March,23,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep mid and upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through east, where slabs of wind drifted snow failing on the old dry snow can be triggered.   Other terrain has a LOW avalanche danger early this morning, but the danger will increase to MODERATE for wet snow sluffs with heating and sun."
March,22,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through east, where slab avalanches failing on the old dry snow can be triggered. Other terrain has a LOW avalanche danger, though small sluffs and soft slabs can be triggered, especially this afternoon during periods of snowfall or increased wind.  Avoid spending time beneath cornices, glide cracks and steep roofs."
March,21,2019,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features.  If we see more snow than expected, look for sluffing or pockety wind drifts in the storm snow...and the danger will rise accordingly."
March,20,2019,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  Pockets of MODERATE danger, however, may exist for newly developed shallow wind drifts in steep north facing terrain.  Shallow wet loose avalanches are again possible with daytime heating."
March,19,2019,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW and snow conditions are mostly stable. Low danger doesn't mean no danger and it is still important to maintain avalanche awareness. On very steep, upper elevation, northerly aspects, it is still possible to trigger small, loose, dry sluffs that could carry you over a cliff if you were caught unaware. And as the day heats up, minimize your exposure to loose, wet avalanches by avoiding steep slopes that are becoming wet and sloppy."
March,18,2019,"The hazard starts out Low this morning, rising to Moderate with the primary hazard of wet loose avalanches as the snow heats up from the sun. On steep northerly aspects at the upper elevations, dry/loose sluffs as well as shallow soft slab avalanches are possible. 

Timing is everything - plan to be off of and out from underneath steeper slopes once the snow surface warms, including lower elevation exits on all aspects."
March,17,2019,"The avalanche danger is LOW early this morning, but will rapidly increase to MODERATE for Wet Snow avalanches in almost all steep backcountry terrain. 

Travel advice is straight forward:  when the snow becomes damp or wet where you are, get off of and out from under steep slopes.  Wet sluffs that can carry and bury a person will be easy to trigger and natural avalanches will occur.  Head to low angle terrain and avoid run out zones like the bottom of gullies.


On upper elevation, steep, shady slopes, isolated shallow soft slab avalanches and sluffs can still be triggered."

On upper elevation, shady slopes isolated shallow soft slab avalanches and sluffs can be triggered, serious in steep terrain."
March,15,2019,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW early this morning, but will rapidly increase to MODERATE for Wet Snow avalanches on and below steep, sunny slopes and on all low elevation slopes.  When the snow becomes damp, get off of and out from under the steep slopes, as wet sluffs will be easy to trigger and natural avalanches can occur.  Have an exit plan that avoids steep, low elevation terrain.
On upper elevation, shady slopes isolated New Snow storm slabs, wind slabs and sluffs can be triggered in steep terrain."
March,14,2019,"The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE at all elevations and aspects for triggering, loose dry, storm slabs, and wind drifted snow avalanches.  However, there is a CONSIDERABLE danger at upper elevations for areas that received the most snow, where you're more likely to trigger an avalanche.  Seek out wind sheltered terrain that's generally less steep than 32° degrees with clean run-outs.  This will drastically reduce your exposure to avalanches and consequences. 

The avalanche danger could spike immediately to CONSIDERABLE on sunny slopes if the sun decides to come out this afternoon."
March,13,2019,"The avalanche hazard is MODERATE at the upper elevations for new snow and wind drifted snow. This includes long-running sluffs, storm slabs, and fresh wind drifts.  On northerly aspects at the mid elevations the hazard is MODERATE for sluffing in the new snow. The hazard is Low elsewhere."
March,12,2019,"Timing is everything today. The avalanche hazard starts out generally Low, but will rise to at least Moderate with heating from the sun. This includes east, west, and south aspects as well as low elevation northerly aspects. Both wet loose and cohesive wet slab avalanches are possible. Sluffing and small wind and storm slabs are possible in steep, upper elevation northerly terrain."
March,11,2019,"Localized areas of MODERATE danger still exist in the mid and upper elevations for recent storm snow instabilities.  With any extended sun and heating today, the danger on the steep sunlit slopes will rise accordingly.  
Safe and excellent powder riding can be found on low angle northerly slopes with no overhead hazard."
March,10,2019,"A MODERATE DANGER exists for human triggered avalanches 1-2'+ deep and a couple hundred feet wide on a variety of aspects and elevations...and pockety in the lower elevations.  Loose snow sluffs may run fast and far, especially on the steepest southerly aspects.  If the sun or greenhousing manifests, wet avalanches are to be expected.  
Safe and excellent powder riding can be found on low angle northerly slopes with no overhead hazard."
March,09,2019,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all steep upper elevation slopes.  New snow avalanches 1 to 3 feet deep can be triggered, as well as loose snow avalanches that will run fast and far.  Use cautious route finding and conservative decision making today.  

The warm, new snow instabilities strengthen quickly, have patience for just a day or two before stepping into bigger, sustained steep terrain.  For now, the vast untracked acres of surfy snow on lower angled slopes offer a much lower danger, as due slopes that have received generally less than a foot of new snow."
March,08,2019,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all aspects at upper elevations, especially slopes with wind drifts - triggering a 2 foot deep wind drift is likely.  The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the mid and low elevations for triggering a small wind drift, new snow slide, or a wet loose sluff at the lower elevations.   Use cautious route finding and conservative decision at the upper elevations in the backcountry today."

The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the mid and low elevations for triggering a small wind drift, new snow slide, or a wet loose sluff at the lower elevations.   Use cautious route finding and conservative decision at the upper elevations in the backcountry today."
March,06,2019,"Today there are three avalanche problems to watch for. Strong southerly winds have drifted snow and formed fresh slabs that should be easily triggered today. With more snow and more wind, these slabs will make the danger CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations. As snow falls today, shallow soft slabs of new snow could produce avalanches at upper and mid elevations. At low and mid elevations, the snow is already wet and rain will make wet avalanches a problem watch for. The avalanche danger at mid and lower elevations is MODERATE but could rise higher if more snow falls than is expected."
March,05,2019,"The day begins with generally Low hazard, but will rise to Moderate as the day warms where wet, loose avalanches are possible on solar aspects. Increasing westerly winds will create pockets of fresh wind drifts on upper elevation aspects facing north through southeast. A very warm, wet, and windy storm will raise the avalanche hazard over the next few days."
March,04,2019,"Terrain less steep than 35° not beneath steeper slopes has a LOW danger. Areas of MODERATE danger exists for both wet and dry point release avalanches on all aspects with the danger more pronounced at the mid and upper elevations.  Some of these may run naturally with enough heating or any direct sun this afternoon.  Isolated areas in the alpine still host lingering shallow wind drifts.   
KEY POINT! Safe Travel protocol saves lives-

Don't Sluff Your Bro.  Or the road."
March,03,2019,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  
If you're looking for MODERATE danger, you'll find shallow and pockety wind drifts and loose sluffs that'll pack a punch in the steepest terrain of the upper elevations.  Remember that radical terrain accentuates the overall risk for otherwise harmless avalanches."
March,02,2019,"A MODERATE AVALANCHE DANGER exists on steep, wind drifted slopes at the upper elevations for triggering a wind slab avalanche.  This problem will be confined to the upper elevation ridgelines and steep terrain features.  Out of the wind effected snow the avalanche danger is LOW. 


Cornices have grown massive and could break off at anytime.  Avoid being on or underneath these giants."
March,01,2019,"A MODERATE AVALANCHE DANGER exists on steep, wind drifted slopes at the upper elevations and some mid elevation slopes.  These reactive wind drifts will be most widespread on northwest through easterly facing slopes, and their size will increase with elevation.  These avalanches are large enough to catch and carry a person, and could run far and fast on the hard old surfaces.   Other terrain has a LOW avalanche danger, though isolated, small wind drifts can still be triggered."
February,28,2019,"There is a MODERATE avalanche danger on upper elevation slopes where one of the scattered, hard wind drifts or a cornice can be triggered.  There is also a MODERATE danger on mid and low elevation slopes facing northwest through easterly for triggering an isolated wind drift or triggering a wet loose sluff in steep terrain, especially if it rains where you are.  In the LOW danger areas, isolated small, wet loose sluffs are possible."
February,27,2019,Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE at upper elevation where slabs of wind drifted snow can avalanche. At mid and lower elevations wet snow avalanches of loose snow are possible and the danger is MODERATE in these areas as well.
February,26,2019,"The avalanche hazard is MODERATE at the mid and upper elevations for fresh wind drifts. Although any drifts you encounter are likely to be found on aspects facing north through southeast, cross-loading may create drifts on any aspect. Avoid wind-drifted terrain and you avoid the problem.
Watch for wet loose activity today on steep southerly aspects as well as the lower elevations."
February,25,2019,"The avalanche hazard is MODERATE at the mid and upper elevations for fresh wind drifts. Although any drifts you encounter are likely to be found on aspects facing north through southeast, cross-loading may create drifts on any aspect. Outside of wind-drifted terrain, the hazard is generally Low.
Watch for wet loose activity today in the lower elevations as the cold, dry snowpack may be reactive to today's warmth and cloud cover."
February,24,2019,"A MODERATE danger exists for recent and developing wind drifts today.  The drifts will be most pronounced on steep north to east to south facing slopes above about 8000'...and pockety elsewhere.  Watch for sluffing in the steepest, most confined terrain.  Wind sheltered terrain has a generally LOW danger. 
With additional snow and wind in the forecast, the danger will be on the rise for tomorrow."
February,23,2019,"A MODERATE danger exists for new and developing wind drifts today.  The sensitive drifts will be most pronounced on steep north to east to south facing slopes above about 8000'...and pockety elsewhere.  Watch for sluffing in the steepest, most confined terrain.  Wind sheltered terrain has a generally LOW danger. Uncertainty exists for any wet loose point releases on the southerly facing slopes today - so watch for any wet rollerballs or sluffing with daytime warming."
February,22,2019,"A MODERATE AVALANCHE DANGER exists at mid and upper elevations for triggering a soft slab of wind drifted snow or a loose snow sluff. Avoid travel on and below the huge cornices. At low elevations the danger is LOW, though there are scattered wind drifts to be avoided.




Other parts of the Ogden area mountains received less snow and have a lower danger today."
February,21,2019,"In areas of the Ogden mountains that received more than a foot of new snow, THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE AVALANCHE DANGER on the wind drifted slopes at the upper elevations for triggering a new or old slab of wind drifted snow or a loose snow sluff.   Avoid travel on and below the huge cornices. At mid elevations the danger is MODERATE, and the danger is LOW at the low elevations.  At these elevations, still identify and avoid wind drifts, including near the canyon mouths, and getting caught in a loose snow sluff.



Other parts of the Ogden area mountains received less snow and have a lower danger today."
February,20,2019,"With over a foot of new snow since yesterday morning and strong southerly winds at the highest ridgetops, human triggered avalanches are likely on any slope with wind drifted snow. The new snow may also produces very soft sluffs in the new snow even on non wind affected slopes. For these reasons the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations, MODERATE at mid and low elevations. Other parts of the Ogden area mountains received less snow and should have a lower danger but the danger today is based on places with the highest snow fall amounts."
February,19,2019,"A MODERATE DANGER exists on all upper elevation wind loaded slopes for triggering new and old wind drifted slabs of snow.  The danger is most pronounced on steep, upper elevation northerly through easterly facing terrain.  The new snow could be sensitive to the weight of a rider and shallow soft slabs might become possible in the wind effected terrain today.  Cornices are an issue - Exercise great caution along and underneath the heavily corniced ridgelines.

February,15,2019,"The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE at mid and upper elevations where heavy snowfall and strong winds have created dense storm and wind slabs. At low elevations the hazard is MODERATE, where human-triggered loose wet avalanches are possible.  Additionally, many homes and building in the Ogden Valley have deep snowpacks on their roofs.  Avoid being underneath any steep roof with a load of snow. 
The best - and safest - terrain today will be wind-sheltered, lower-angled slopes above about 7500' where the dense snow will be soft and supportable.
Expecting a rising avalanche hazard by later in the day with increasing winds and snowfall, with the hazard possibly reaching HIGH by later in the day or early evening."
February,14,2019,"Heavy snowfall and strong winds has elevated the avalanche hazard, and the danger is HIGH at upper elevations, and CONSIDERABLE at mid and lower elevations. There are many different avalanche concerns for today, including fresh wind-drifted snow at the mid and upper elevations, storm snow at all elevations, and wet snow at low and mid elevations. Cautious terrain selection is crucial today - avoid being on or underneath slopes steeper than about 30 degrees. Additionally, many homes and building in the Ogden Valley have deep snowpacks on their roofs. Today's warming weather may cause these roofs to shed their entire snowpack, so avoid being underneath any steep roofs that have a load of snow.

February,13,2019,"It is a day of rising danger, with the avalanche hazard reaching CONSIDERABLE by this afternoon at mid and upper elevations facing west, through north, and east. The primary avalanche concern are recent and new wind slabs at the mid and upper elevations. Cornices are also growing and may break off naturally. Avoid traveling on a slope beneath cornices, and stay well back from a corniced ridgeline. Possible rain on snow at lower elevations add to the list of avalanche concerns, as well as sluffing in the new snow and shallow, sensitive storm slabs that may develop during any period of higher precipitation intensity.
The avalanche hazard will likely rise to HIGH by later this week, with elevated avalanche hazard through at least the holiday weekend."
February,12,2019,"The avalanche danger will rise toward the high end of MODERATE today for fresh wind drifts and wet loose avalanches.  Avoid being on any of the steep sunlit slopes when they've become wet and unstable.  The best and safest skiing and riding will be in the protected glades on low angle slopes. 
Big Picture: The danger will be on the rise over the next several days."
February,11,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on and below steep, wind drifted slopes at all mid and upper elevations.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.

The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on and below steep, wind drifted slopes at the upper elevations. Human triggered avalanches are likely and natural avalanches may become possible. Avoid being on or beneath the heavily corniced ridgelines and in avalanche runout zones such as gullies and couloirs being loaded by the wind or heavy snow.

Seek out non wind-drifted terrain . Wind sheltered, low and mid elevation terrain has a LOW TO MODERATE danger, and much better turning conditions."
February,09,2019,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on and below the steep, wind drifted slopes at the upper elevations.  This means human triggered avalanches are likely and natural avalanches possible.  The avalanche danger is MODERATE on wind drifted slopes at the mid elevations.  Some avalanches may be triggered at a distance or from below.  Be aware of what is above you, and avoid travel in avalanche runout zones such as the bottom of gullies and couloirs and travel below slopes being loaded by the wind.  Hell's Canyon is a prime example of a gully and avalanche run out zone that is the type of terrain that should be avoided today.  The growing cornices are unstable, and will break back further than expected.
Seek out terrain without wind-drifts or wind slabs.  Wind sheltered, mid elevation terrain has a much lower avalanche danger (and much better turning conditions!)."
February,08,2019,The avalanche danger is along the higher end of MODERATE.  Human triggered wind slab avalanches are possible on many slopes at the mid and upper elevations.

Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, and identify features of concern. Human triggered avalanches are possible."
January,09,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep mid and upper elevation slopes for triggering new drifts of wind blown snow, which will be most widespread on the northwest through southeast facing slopes.   There is a MODERATE danger at the mid and low elevations for triggering wind drifts, new snow slides and for wet loose sluffs, on both southerly and northerly facing slopes."
January,08,2019,"Dangerous avalanche conditions - the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all steep low, mid and upper elevation slopes for triggering slabs of wind-drifted snow, which can be found on all aspects.  CONSIDERABLE means human triggered slides are likely, and natural avalanche possible.   Avalanches breaking on faceted weak layers can be triggered from a distance or below, especially on wind loaded slopes.  Wet loose sluffs are possible on steep, sunny slopes as temperatures warm today.
Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision making are essential for backcountry travel today.  Low angle, wind sheltered terrain is the place to go."
January,07,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is HIGH on all slopes. Heavy snowfall and strong south winds are rapidly loading slopes. Avoid all avalanche terrain today. Avoid being near or under any steep slope. The problem is not just the amount of snow and wind, but it is also the rate at which snow is falling which makes such dangerous conditions."
January,06,2019,"The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE on all aspects in open, exposed terrain above 8500' for wind drifted snow, particularly on aspects facing north, northeast, and east. Snowfall today may create sensitive storm slabs on all aspects at all elevations.  On slopes below 8500' the hazard is MODERATE.  
The easiest recipe to enjoy today's storm snow is stick to low-angled, wind-sheltered terrain.


The hazard will be increasing as the day progresses, likely rising to HIGH by Monday morning."
January,05,2019,"Today's avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Pockets of new and developing wind drifts may be found in isolated terrain.  The danger may reach MODERATE in some areas later today.  Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel - even a small avalanche can be significant in radical, no-fall terrain.  


BIG PICTURE: The danger will be on the rise over the next several days and may reach HIGH in some areas.  Stay tuned."
January,04,2019,"Today's avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Minor wet and dry sluffs are possible on steep slopes. Remember that risk is inherent in mountain travel - even a small sluff can be significant in radical, no-fall terrain."
January,03,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep upper elevation slopes where slabs of wind-drifted snow can be found.  Be on the lookout and avoid, rounded, pillowy, wind drifted snow.  Out of the wind effected snow the avalanche danger is LOW.  As the day heats up the southerly facing terrain might become loose enough to produce a few small avalanches from the direct sun. 

More info on wind drifted snow HERE."
January,02,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep upper elevation slopes where slabs of wind-drifted snow can be found on all aspects because of various wind directions in the past week. The most recent drifts are obvious, but others are hidden beneath the snow. Wind-sheltered slopes have the best skiing and riding, where you may get a bit of sluffing in the steepest terrain."
January,01,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all steep upper elevation slopes where dense slabs of wind-drifted snow can be found on all aspects because of the various wind directions. Some drifts will be obvious, others hidden beneath snow, and they will tend to break above you, not at your feet. The danger for wind drifts is MODERATE at mid and low elevations, including the foothills. Wind-sheltered slopes will still have good skiing and riding, where the main issue will be sluffing of the new snow in steep terrain."
December,31,2019,"The overall avalanche danger is LOW. Despite the generally safe conditions, some amount of avalanche danger always exists:  Know that isolated wind drifts and loose snow sluffs remain possible in steep terrain. 


Heads Up: Tomorrow's storm will be a game changer. The avalanche danger may reach HIGH in the coming days."
December,30,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE at upper elevations where some soft slabs of wind drifted snow exist.

The avalanche danger at mid and low elevations is LOW and avalanche conditions are generally safe.

Most slopes have great powder and are unaffected by recent northerly winds. The new snow is so light that it may sluff on the steepest slopes. Despite the generally safe conditions, some amount of avalanche danger always exists. Carry rescue gear, only expose one person at a time, and keep eyes on your partners from a safe location while they are in avalanche terrain."
December,29,2019,"Watch for soft slabs of wind drifted snow at upper elevations where the avalanche danger is MODERATE. At mid and lower elevations, avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger is LOW.


A low danger means that avalanches are unlikely but danger still exists. Travel smart and only expose one person at a time to avalanche terrain. Don't let the excitement of great powder lull you into being complacent in how you travel."
December,28,2019,"Today there is a MODERATE danger on all upper elevation terrain where the winds have increased and begun transporting snow and forming wind drifts. Look for signs of wind drifted snow in steep terrain and avoid them.
Mid-elevation slopes that don't have signs of wind drifted snow and low elevation slopes are LOW where generally safe avalanche conditions exist, and human triggered avalanches are unlikely."
December,27,2019,"A LOW DANGER exists in the Ogden area mountains.  Remember that LOW does not mean NO danger.  This should be your starting point this morning.  If you see different conditions, adjust your travel choices accordingly.  Isolated human triggered sluffs and pockety shallow storm snow avalanches remain possible in steep terrain today."
December,26,2019,A MODERATE danger exists for human triggered storm snow avalanches on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.
December,25,2019,A MODERATE hazard exists at the upper elevations on aspects facing northwest through east for triggering isolated pockets of sensitive wind drifts as well as shallow sluffs in loose storm snow. All other terrain has a generally Low hazard.
December,24,2019,"A MODERATE hazard exists at the upper elevations, and mid-elevation aspects facing northwest through east, where strong and gusty winds from the south have created pockets of hard wind drifts. These hard wind slabs may allow you to get well onto a slope before they avalanche, breaking well above you."
December,23,2019,"A more widespread and tricky MODERATE avalanche danger exists for Wind Drifted Snow on a variety of aspects at the mid and upper elevations. These hard windslabs are unmanageable and should be avoided.  
There is also a MODERATE danger for Wet Snow avalanches found at the low and mid elevation northerly facing terrain.  Avoid being in terrain traps and gullies where wet snow can pile up.  Roller balls and wet loose sluffs are a sign that the snow is becoming unstable."
December,22,2019,"A more widespread and tricky MODERATE danger exists for wind drifts on a variety of aspects and elevations. These windslabs are increasingly unmanageable.  Lastly - and I can't believe I'm saying this - wet loose sluffs may also be triggered in warm, wind sheltered terrain and may pile up more deeply in terrain traps.
Strange weather causes strange avalanches."
December,21,2019,"The danger will rise to MODERATE for fresh drifts of wind blown snow.  These soft and hard wind drifts will be scattered across the mid and upper elevations and more prominent on north to east facing slopes.  
Wet loose sluffs may also be triggered in warm, wind sheltered terrain and may pile up more deeply in terrain traps."
December,20,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all upper elevation slopes where the main avalanche problem is fresh slabs of wind drifted snow. Continue to look for and avoid pillowy, rounded snow. 

Below 8,500' in elevation, avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger is LOW."
December,19,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all upper elevation slopes where the main avalanche problem is fresh slabs of wind drifted snow. Following yesterday's increased southwest winds, look for and avoid pillowy, rounded snow. 

Below 8,500' in elevation, avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger is LOW."
December,18,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all upper elevation slopes where the main avalanche problem is fresh slabs of wind drifted snow as today's winds increase from the southwest.  Below 8,500' in elevation, avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger is LOW."
December,17,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all upper elevation steep slopes where human triggered avalanches 1-2' are possible.  Caution is warranted in all steep terrain.  Proper assessment and safe travel protocol is key. Below 8,500' in elevation you will find a LOW avalanche danger."
December,16,2019,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all mid and upper elevation steep slopes where human triggered avalanches 1-2' are possible.  Caution is warranted in all steep terrain.  Proper assessmeent and safe travel protocol is key. Below 7,000' in elevation you will find a LOW avalanche danger."
December,15,2019,"The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE in the upper elevations and MODERATE elsewhere.  Human triggered avalanches 1-2' are possible and caution is warranted in all steep terrain.  Proper assessmeent and safe travel protocol is key.  


If this is too much, enjoy the powder at one of our world class ski resorts."
December,14,2019,"The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE at the mid and upper elevations.  Human triggered avalanches are probable with natural avalanches possible during periods of higher snowfall intensity or wind.  New snow avalanches may be enough to step down near the ground at the upper elevation northerly slopes.  


Caution is warranted:  Avoid being on or underneath slopes steeper than 30 degrees on these mid and upper elevation aspects.



If this is too much, enjoy the powder at one of our world class ski resorts."
December,13,2019,"The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE at the upper elevations, and mid-elevations facing northwest, through north, and east where sensitive storm snow and wind drifts can be found. On upper elevation northerly slopes, weak faceted snow down near the ground has been overloaded by the storm snow and wind drifts, where any avalanches may be 2-3' deep.



Avoid being on or underneath slopes steeper than 30 degrees on these mid and upper elevation aspects.



Mid elevation aspects facing west through southeast, and low elevations, have a Moderate avalanche hazard.



Fortunately, the dense snow provides excellent riding conditions on low-angled, wind-sheltered terrain."
December,12,2019,"With increased snow and wind the avalanche danger will be on the rise.

Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on northerly facing upper elevation slopes where the persistent weak layer is at the ground. New snow and increased winds will only add stress to this layer making human triggered avalanches likely on this layer.

Other upper elevations and all mid-elevation slopes have a MODERATE danger due to sustained and increasing winds in combination with increased wet snowfall, look for and avoid areas of wind drifted snow. 

Low and mid-elevations have generally safe avalanche conditions and a LOW danger."
December,11,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on northerly facing upper elevation slopes where the persistent weak layer is at the ground. Recent warm weather has strengthened the snowpack, but triggering an avalanche on old weak snow near the ground remains possible.
Other upper elevation slopes have a MODERATE danger due to sustained winds, look for and avoid areas of wind drifted snow. 

Low and mid-elevations have generally safe avalanche conditions and a LOW danger."
December,10,2019,"Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger still exist on upper elevation northerly facing slopes for triggering an avalanche that breaks into old faceted snow.

December,08,2019,"Areas of MODERATE danger still exist on upper elevation northerly facing slopes. Recent warm weather has strengthened the snowpack, but triggering an avalanche on old weak snow near the ground remains possible. With additional snow and wind, the danger will rise to MODERATE for shallow wind drifts and new snow avalanches on a variety of aspects."
December,07,2019,"Areas of MODERATE danger exist on upper elevation northerly facing slopes. Recent warm weather has strengthened the snowpack, but triggering an avalanche on old weak snow near the ground remains possible. A MODERATE danger also exists for fresh wind drifts in lee terrain."
December,06,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation northerly facing slopes. Recent warm weather has strengthened the snowpack, but triggering an avalanche on old weak snow near the ground remains possible. Although other slopes have a Low avalanche danger, there are avalanche concerns including pockets of fresh wind slabs, sluffing in recent storm snow on steeper aspects, and sluffing in loose wet snow at lower elevations as well as steeper southerly aspects from warming temperatures today."
December,05,2019,Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation northerly facing slopes. Recent warm weather has strengthened the snowpack but triggering an avalanche on old weak snow near the ground remains possible. All other slopes have a LOW avalanche danger.
December,04,2019,Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on mid and upper elevation northerly and east-facing slopes. Recent warm weather has strengthened the snowpack but triggering an avalanche on old weak snow near the ground or a slab of wind drifted snow remains possible. All other slopes have a LOW avalanche danger.
December,03,2019,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on northerly facing upper elevation slopes where a soft slab of snow rest on top of a layer of old, faceted snow. All other slopes at upper elevations and all mid-elevation slopes have a MODERATE danger where recently formed slabs of wind drifted snow are the main avalanche hazard. Low elevations below 7000 feet have a LOW avalanche danger."
December,02,2019,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist on upper elevation northwest to easterly facing slopes.  Large and dangerous avalanche conditions exist on many of these slopes.  Areas of MODERATE danger exist for wind drifts on many aspects and elevations and should be avoided.  The safest and best riding today will be found on low angle sun and wind sheltered slopes with nothing steeper above.  
The amplified winds have also pushed the danger for wind drifts on many lee slopes and should be avoided in steep terrain today."
December,01,2019,The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevations facing northwest through east where avalanches may fail on a weak layer of snow down at the ground.  The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all mid and upper elevation aspects that DO NOT have old snow for triggering wind drifted snow avalanches.  At low elevations the Danger is LOW.
November,30,2019,The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevations facing northwest through east where avalanches may fail on a weak layer of snow down at the ground.  The hazard is CONSIDERABLE on all mid and upper elevation aspects for triggering new snow avalanches as well as wind drifted snow avalanches.  At low elevations the hazard is Moderate.  Avoid being on and underneath any slopes steeper than 30 degrees.
November,29,2019,"The avalanche hazard is HIGH on upper elevations facing northwest through east where avalanches may fail on a weak layer of snow down at the ground. At the mid-elevations, the hazard is CONSIDERABLE on aspects facing northwest, through northeast and southeast. At low elevations the hazard is Moderate.
South winds have likely created fresh wind drifts at the mid and upper elevations, with heavy, dense snow at all elevations. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended - avoid being on and underneath any slopes steeper than 30 degrees."
November,28,2019,"Today's rapid, heavy snowfall has created several avalanche problems. At the highest elevations on northerly facing slopes old faceted snow exists under the new snow and will make a weak layer on which avalanches can fracture. Southerly winds, as well as warming temperatures, have likely created soft slabs in the new snow that can also make an avalanche.

The avalanche danger is HIGH at the highest elevations on northerly and east-facing slopes that likely have a layer of old snow where the travel advice is to avoid all avalanche terrain. Winds blowing from the southwest have created a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger at mid-elevation northerly and east-facing slopes as well as upper elevation southeast facing slopes. All low elevation terrain has a MODERATE avalanche danger.

The best thing to do is simply avoid avalanche terrain today which is any slope steeper than 30 degrees. Exercise patience and give the new snow time to settle and gain strength."
November,27,2019,"HEADS UP: The avalanche danger will be increasing during the next few days as a major storm impacts most of the state.


Today, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation northerly facing slopes. A combination of wind drifted snow and old, weak, faceted snow underneath will create dangerous avalanche conditions on these slopes. A MODERATE danger exists on upper elevation, southerly facing slopes, and on mid-elevations northerly facing slopes.


Slopes at low elevations and south-facing slopes mid-elevations, simply don't have enough snow to ride and hardly enough snow to create an avalanche, thus they have a LOW danger.




What to do? The only viable strategy is to ride low angle slopes (less than 30 degrees in steepness) which are not steep enough for an avalanche. With such thin snow cover, hitting rocks or stumps remains the greatest hazard."
November,26,2019,"A MODERATE danger exists in upper elevation wind drifted slopes.  Human triggered avalanches are possible but generally relegated to steep northerly to easterly facing slopes.  Sluffing in the new snow is likely.  
Outlook: the outlook is not good for the rest of the week as the danger may reach CONSIDERABLE to HIGH in the coming days. This includes sidecountry terrain. Please spread the word to friends and neighbors who may be unaware."
November,25,2019,"The avalanche danger will be on the rise with the first of two storms.  The danger today will start out at LOW, move to MODERATE, and possibly move to CONSIDERABLE if we see enough snow and wind.   Sluffing is expected in the new snow and human triggered avalanches will be more likely as the day wears on.  
Remember: If snow is the question, Terrain is the answer: choose low angle terrain not beneath anything steep.  There will come a time (late afternoon?) when we will be able to trigger avalanches from a distance or below."
November,22,2019,"Other than some sluffing in the new snow, there is not enough snow and wind to significantly change the avalanche danger at this time; however, remember that risk is always inherent in mountain travel.  


We are not issuing danger ratings at this time, but are posting observations every day now, so submit an avalanche or observation HERE. Read observations HERE."

November,20,2019,"Avalanche season is here, with shady upper elevation slopes where old snow exists the bulls eye terrain for avalanches today.  With the first few inches of snow today, expect new snow sluffs.  If we get more than about 6 inches of snow, with wind, expect to trigger shallow slabs breaking on the persistent weak layer.  Evaluate snow and terrain carefully today.
If you get caught and go for a ride even in a small slide, hitting rocks and stumps is likely. 


We will provide an updates again Thursday and Friday, but we are not issuing danger rating.

October,25,2019,"FRIDAY AFTERNOON, OCTOBER 25
The shallow layer of mid October snow on the ground has become sugary and weak.   Thin, cracky slabs of wind drifted snow sitting on this weak snow can be triggered.  The increasing winds Saturday and more wind and snow Sunday will up your chances of triggering a thicker wind drift and or small sluff.  Blowing snow and cracking wind drifts are the clues to unstable snow this weekend. 

 We are posting observations every day now, so submit an avalanche or observation HERE.    Read observations HERE."
April,15,2018,"This morning we will start with a LOW avalanche danger on all aspects and elevations.  However, with warming temperatures the danger for wet loose avalanches may quickly rise to MODERATE on all mid to upper elevation aspects.  Keep an eye on the snow surface and notice if it's becoming damp or wet.  The bulls eye clue to warming snow is rollerballs and pinwheels cascading down the mountain.  
If you're getting into extreme terrain today watch for icy slide-for-life conditions and always be on the lookout for windslabs."
April,14,2018,"Because the old snow underneath is hard and frozen, avalanche issues exist only in the 13 inches of new snow.
First, watch for wind slabs at the upper elevations where the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Many wind slabs should be well bonded this morning but there are probably some that can still be triggered.
Second, as the day warms, the new snow on slopes receiving direct sunshine should become wet and produce some wet loose avalanches. The avalanche danger on these slopes at mid and upper elevations is MODERATE as well.
Slopes that do not have wind-blown snow and are not getting wet from warming have a LOW danger."
April,13,2018,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE in upper elevation terrain facing the eastern half of the compass. Strong winds and heavy snowfall have created dangerous avalanche conditions - careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision making are essential for safe travel in avalanche terrain today. Both triggered loose storm snow and soft slabs are also possible on slopes steeper than 35 degrees."
April,12,2018,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE for new snow instabilities today, particularly with developing wind slabs along the mid and upper elevations.  These drifts will be more pronounced on northeast to southeast facing slopes and just to the lee of the ridgelines, and potentially crossloaded beyond the subridges, spines, convexities, and other terrain features.  With sustained winds, I expect drifts to become thicker and more widespread over the next 24-36 hours."
April,11,2018,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, but small avalanches can still be triggered in isolated areas or extreme terrain.  So use normal caution.  With a hot day in store, watch for heating of the snow - it may become possible to trigger wet loose sluffs when the snow becomes wet and sloppy or punchy.  Also look for and avoid any small wind drifts along the highest ridge lines. 
With hard bed surfaces, slide for life's are possible, especially early in the day, and even a very small sluff or wind drift at the upper elevations could knock you off your feet."

Unusual conditions:  with hard, icy bed surfaces, slide for life's are possible, and even a very small sluff or wind drift at the upper elevations could knock you off your feet."
April,08,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE at all mid and upper elevations for wet slab avalanches.  Heavy rain up to 10,000 feet has soaked the snowpack.  Water percolating through the snowpack could awaken buried layers and cause wet slab avalanches to break 3-5 feet deep.  
The danger of these wet slabs should go away quickly with forecasted colder temperatures and no more water being added to the snowpack.  For today, it's best to let the snowpack adjust to its load."
April,07,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at mid and upper elevations. Rain yesterday and heavy rain today will cause both wet loose and wet slab avalanches.
Most avalanche activity will be wet loose avalanches. However, larger wet slab avalanches may occur as well. It's hard to forecast for wet slab avalanches but they could break 3-5 feet deep and be very destructive."
April,06,2018,Avalanche conditions are generally safe and the danger is LOW. Watch for loose wet avalanches if the snowpack becomes overly saturated. Avoid sagging cornices as they could break back further than you expect.
April,05,2018,"Avalanche conditions are generally safe and the danger is LOW. With minimal warming and light winds, the situation won't change much today; however, a disturbance tonight and another storm on Saturday should bring snow above 9000 feet."
April,04,2018,"Avalanche conditions are generally safe and the danger is LOW. Watch for and avoid fresh wind drifts. These drifts should be small and not very sensitive. Hard, icy conditions also exist. While not an avalanche hazard, these ""slide for life"" conditions add an additional hazard in very steep terrain."
April,03,2018,"The avalanche danger is LOW with generally safe avalanche conditions.  Watch for and avoid any new drifts of wind blown snow.  There are widespread icy crusts on most aspects and elevations - so be prepared for hard, “slide for life” conditions in steep terrain.

April,01,2018,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW this morning, but will rise to MODERATE with daytime heating. Wet loose sluffs will become easy to trigger on steep slopes when the snow heats. Early starts and early finishes is the springtime mantra.
In steep, upper elevation northerly through easterly facing slopes, shallow wind drifts can be triggered in very isolated places and there remains a very slight chance of triggering a deep slab avalanche. Slopes that are rocky or shallower snow pack, especially terrain that avalanched one or more times this winter, are most suspect"
March,31,2018,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW this morning, but may rise to MODERATE with daytime heating.  Wet loose sluffs could become easy to trigger if you are on steep slopes when the skies clear and there is strong sun.
In isolated areas, shallow wind drifts can be triggered, most likely on upper elevation, northerly through easterly facing slopes.  There also remains a very slight chance of triggering a deep slab avalanche, again most likely in upper elevation northerly through easterly facing terrain that is rocky or has a shallower snow pack, especially slopes that avalanched one or more times this winter."
March,30,2018,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW. Low danger does not mean no danger. There is still a chance you could trigger a small wind slab avalanche in steep upper elevation exposed terrain. Also, avoid the steep sunny aspects by midday and afternoon as they may become wet and unstable."
March,29,2018,A MODERATE danger exists for wind drifts on many slopes in the mid and upper elevations.  Watch for cross-loading onto other aspects and around other terrain features. Avoid the steep sunny aspects by midday and afternoon as they may become wet and unstable.
March,28,2018,"Many areas continue to have an overall LOW avalanche danger. A MODERATE danger now exists for new and developing wind drifts primarily in steep north through east through south facing slopes in the uppe elevations. Watch for cross-loading onto other aspects and around other terrain features.
The smart money today heads for lower angle wind and sun sheltered terrain."
March,27,2018,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE for wet loose avalanches at the mid and upper elevation steep east through west facing terrain.  You'll find an isolated MODERATE danger for deep slabs at upper elevation northwest through east facing terrain. LOW danger elsewhere.
Loose dry avalanches, and shallow wind slabs can be triggered today, especially at the upper elevation northerly facing terrain.  Even a small slide is serious if a ride would carry you off a cliff, into trees or down a long, icy slope."
March,26,2018,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE at the upper elevations. 
Shallow wind drifts, sluffs and new snow soft slabs can be triggered on steep slopes, most likely on northerly through easterly facing slopes. Even a small slide can be dangerous in radical terrain.
There is also an isolated chance of triggering a Persistent Slab avalanche 1 to 3 feet deep on northerly through easterly facing slopes at the upper elevations. Slopes that are rocky or have a shallower snowpack are most suspect, especially in terrain that has slid one or more times this year"

Slopes that are rocky or have a shallower snowpack are most suspect, especially in terrain that has slid one or more times this year"
March,24,2018,"Avalanche conditions are tricky and weird today. Multiple problems involving dry snow and wet snow exist. Until the snowpack has a solid refreeze, the best option is to avoid avalanche terrain by riding slopes less than 30 degrees without steeper ones above you.

Mid and upper elevations have dangerous avalanche conditions and a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger. Wet loose avalanches and persistent slab avalanches can occur in these elevations. Wind slabs can be found as well but should be shallow.
Low elevations have minimal snow and a LOW danger. Any snow remaining after Thursday's drenching rain, is likely to stay in place today."
March,23,2018,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE. Dangerous avalanche consitions exist - careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision making are essential for safe travel today in the backcountry. Recent heavy rain and snow have created complex conditions - loose wet as well as deeper slab avalanches are major concerns today. 
Avoid steep slopes today. The safest and best riding conditions will be on low-angle, upper elevation slopes."
March,22,2018,"We start out at MODERATE this morning and should be at CONSIDERABLE by late afternoon. Plan for it to go to HIGH danger overnight. Keep an eye on the weather - strong winds, heavy rain and snowfall - all of these lead to a rising avalanche danger on all aspects and elevations. Natural and human triggered avalanches will go from possible to certain within 24 hours. Good luck."
March,21,2018,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE – human triggered avalanches are possible, so evaluate the snow and your choice of terrain carefully.  Persistent slab avalanches can be triggered in isolated areas – steep slopes facing northwest through easterly with a shallower snowpack at the mid and upper elevations are the most suspect. The danger for Wind Slabs and Wet loose sluffs will increase to MODERATE today.  
The danger will be on the rise over the next several days."

Persistent slab avalanches can be triggered in isolated areas – steep slopes facing northwest through easterly with a shallower snowpack at the mid and upper elevations are the most suspect.
Wet loose sluffs: if the clouds remain thin or skies clear where you are, the danger of wet sluffs will increase to MODERATE today on almost all aspects and elevations."
March,19,2018,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE – human triggered avalanches are possible, so evaluate the snow and your choice of terrain carefully.  These are the avalanche problems:
Persistent slab avalanches can be triggered in isolated areas – steep slopes facing northwet through easterly with a shallower snowpack at the mid and upper elevations are the most suspect.
Wet loose sluffs: can be triggered on steeps slopes if the sun comes out or the snow heats where you are
Wind slabs and cornices: avoid the new wind drifts on steep slopes, which are more widespread than yesterday due to the overnight winds.  Avoid travel on and below cornices."
March,18,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE at upper elevations. With new snow and strong southerly winds, fresh wind slabs will be found that will be easy to trigger. Slopes without wind-blown snow still have the potential for persistent slab avalanches."
March,17,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations. With new snow and strong southerly winds, fresh wind slabs will be found that will be easy to trigger. Slopes without wind-blown snow still have the potential for deep slab avalanches."
March,16,2018,The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all mid and upper elevation slopes facing northwest through east facing terrain. Heightened avalanche conditions on specific terrain features. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify features of concern. Human triggered avalanches are possible.
March,15,2018,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at the upper elevations – Dangerous avalanche conditions exist.  Backcountry travel requires careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision-making. These are today's avalanche problems:
Wet loose and wet slab avalanches: can be triggered on mid and low elevation slopes. Cornices, Glide Avalanches and Roof-avalanches are other wet snow problems today.
Persistent Slab avalanches: can be triggered in isolated areas - on steep slopes facing northwest through easterly at the mid and upper elevations.
Storm Snow: new snow avalanches can be triggered at the upper elevations on all aspects, especially on wind drifted slopes, and once moving trigger a deeper slide.
Better and safer conditions can be found low angle terrain at the upper elevations, with nothing steep above you."
March,14,2018,"I expect the danger to rise to CONSIDERABLE for wet slab and wet loose avalanches today. They may be most problematic on easterly (NE>SE) and westerly (NW>SW) aspects. Note that wet avalanches may now include higher elevation northerly slopes with today's warmth and high rain/snow line.
A MODERATE DANGER exists for human triggered slides 1 to 3 feet deep in isolated areas on predominantly (but not limited to) north to southeast facing slopes at the upper elevations. Localized pockets of shallow but perhaps sensitive wind drifts may be found along the higher elevations.
Cornices and Roof-avalanches are also significant hazards to have on the radar today."
March,13,2018,"A MODERATE DANGER exists for human triggered slides 1-3 feet deep in isolated areas on predominantly (but not limited to) north to southeast facing slopes at the upper elevations. The danger will also reach at least MODERATE for wet avalanches on steep sun-kissed terrain. Wet unstable snow is slow but terrifying - avoid the overcooked aspects when they've softened and become unsupportable.
Cornices and Roof-avalanches are also significant hazards to have on the radar today."
March,12,2018,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep slopes facing northwest through southeasterly at the mid and upper elevations.  Avalanches 1 to 2 feet deep can be triggered by a rider, especially in thinner snowpack areas.
Warm temperatures and periods of sun will heat the snow, and wet loose avalanches can be triggered on all aspects on mid and low elevation slopes and on steep, sunny slopes later today.
Roof-avalanches are occurring as snow slides off building roofs, with debris piles deep enough to bury and kill a person."

March,10,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Heightened avalanche danger exists on mid and upper elevation slopes for persistent slab. Evaluate the snow and terrain carfefully. The main concerns for today is:

Lower probability but high consequence human-triggered slides 1-2' deep and a couple hundred feet wide on northwest to north to east facing slopes at the upper and mid elevations. These may be triggered by a new load (skier or rider), especially in thinner snowpack areas.
Good riding conditions can still be found on low angle northerly terrain with no overhead hazard.

March,08,2018,"Today's MODERATE DANGER is two-fold:

Lower probability but high consequence human triggered slides 1-3' deep and a couple hundred feet wide on north to north to east facing slopes at the upper elevations. These may be triggered by heavy loads or in thinner snowpack areas.
Higher probability but more manageable and predictable wet avalanches on the steep sunlit slopes and lower elevation shady slopes with daytime heating. These can still be large enough to bury you, especially if you're dumped into a terrain trap.

ROOF-ALANCHES are likely and have resulted in fatalities in years past.

March,06,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on southerly and westerly aspects for loose wet avalanches. On northerly and easterly aspects at upper elevations, the danger remains CONSIDERABLE for persistent slab avalanches. The loose wet avalanches will occur somewhat predictably as strong sunshine heats up sun exposed slopes. Persistent slab avalanches won't give you any warning. You'll have to dig into the snowpack and assess how it is supporting the load of new snow from this weekend. Triggering an avalanche in new snow and wind blown snow remains possible."
March,05,2018,"The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE in upper elevations for fresh wind drifts, and at the mid and upper elevations for persistent slabs. There is a MODERATE hazard for sluffing in the loose storm snow on steeper aspects. Fortunately, plenty of safer, 5-star riding conditions can be found on lower-angled slopes as well as southerly aspects.
With what many are describing as the best conditions of the year, it is easy to let the brilliant riding cloud good judgement. Be sure to practice the usual safe protocol of exposing one person on a slope at a time and getting out of the runout zone at the bottom. Clearly communicate plans with your partner(s). If you do drop cornices or ski cut slopes, be absolutely sure no one is below you."
March,04,2018,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE and could rise to HIGH during the day due to wind and heavy snowfall. Dangerous avalanche conditions exist in the Ogden area mountains and travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended. 
Recent high winds and expected heavy snowfall have created a complex problem - natural avalanches are possible and human-triggered avalanches are likely on slopes steeper than about 30 degrees. Choose less complex terrain for safe travel today. 
Stay off of and out from under steep slopes at all elevations and avoid travel near or through any avalanche runout zones. 
The safest riding today will be on slopes less than 30 degrees and unconnected to any steeper terrain."
March,03,2018,"The Utah Avalanche Center has issued an AVALANCHE WATCH for dangerous avalanche conditions developing later today and overnight tonight. 
The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE as dangerous avalanche conditions exist on steep, upper elevation slopes with freshly, wind-drifted snow. Wind drifts can be found around the compass, both along and well off the ridges and will increase in depth and distribution throughout the day. With recent human-triggered persistent slab avalanches, north through east facing mid and upper elevation slopes that have weak, faceted layers should be avoided.
With a complex snowpack as well as complex weather, continue to use cautious route finding, careful snowpack evaluation and conservative decision-making.

Large, wide, long running avalanches can be triggered on slope or remotely from below or from adjacent slopes. Avoid steep slopes with freshly wind drifted snow as even a small wind slab could break down in to deeper weak layers and create a larger avalanche.
Those with skills to identify and avoid avalanche terrain will find great riding and turning on low angle slopes less steep than about 30 degrees, which are not below steeper terrain."
January,11,2018,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep mid and upper elevation slopes. The added weight of the recent storm rain/snow has put the snowpack on edge and human triggered avalanches are likely on steep slopes that harbor a poor snowpack structure. Cracking and collapsing are likely and are bullseye clues for instability. Avoid steep slopes with freshly wind drifted snow as even a small wind slab could break down in to deeper weak layers and create a larger avalanche.
Dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision making are essential. The key to safe travel today is to stick to slopes less than 30 degrees which are not connected to or below steeper terrain."
January,10,2018,"The Avalanche Danger will rise to HIGH on steep, mid and upper elevation slopes facing northerly through easterly.   Large, long running avalanches can be triggered or run naturally, especially during periods of heavy snowfall or stronger winds.   A CONSIDERABLE DANGER exists on most other slopes, with dangerous avalanche conditions.  Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.  
Only those with the skills to identify and avoid avalanche terrain should travel in the backcountry today - on slopes less steep about 30 degrees, which are not below steeper terrain, such as meadows and rolling, low angle terrain."
January,09,2018,"We have a RISING AVALANCHE DANGER today and tomorrow and natural avalanches are possibile, especially where the winds are raging in the Ogden mountains. New snow and strong winds have created dangerous avalanche conditions and the danger is CONSIDERABLE for triggering deadly avalanches on a wide variety of weak layers at mid and upper elevations. A MODERATE danger exists on mid and lower elevation slopes that have a southerly aspect. Lower elevations around the compass have a MODERATE danger for loose wet avalanches -  where rain in falling on cold dry snow."
January,08,2018,"The overall avalanche hazard is MODERATE where pockets of fresh wind drifts can be found primarily at the upper elevations. With increasing winds today, I am expecting this hazard to increase, including drifting down off of ridgelines. There also is a MODERATE hazard of a persistent slab avalanche on slopes facing north through east, failing  in a deeper layer of the snowpack.
You may also find minor wet, loose activity at lower elevations as well as aspects facing south and west
On lower-angled slopes, as well as slopes that aren't wind loaded, the hazard is LOW.
We expect a rising avalanche hazard this week, with potentially dangerous conditions by midweek."
January,07,2018,The new snow should create shallow avalanches in many areas today. Northerly facing slopes above 8000 feet with 5 inches of snow or more could have larger avalanches break 2-3 feet deep. The potential for these slides creates dangerous avalanche conditions and the danger is CONSIDERABLE upper elevation slopes. A MODERATE danger exists on mid and lower elevation slopes and ones with a southerly aspect.
January,06,2018,"Avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger is LOW. The snowpack is generally very weak, but is not unstable because it doesn't have stress from new snow. Today's snowfall of only a few inches shouldn't add enough stress to change the situation, but watch out if more than a few inches of snow fall by this afternoon which could raise the danger."
January,05,2018,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Consequences should be your determining factor for route selection as even a short ride in an avalanche could cause serious injury as rocks and stumps linger just under the surface. The safest and, arguably, best riding conditions remain on low angle, sheltered, shady slopes."
January,04,2018,"A MODERATE avalanche danger exists on steep mid and upper elevation northerly through easterly facing slopes. Human triggered slides remain possible and may still be triggered from adjacent terrain or below. The safest and, arguably, best riding conditions remain on low angle terrain on sheltered, shady slopes."
January,03,2018,A MODERATE danger exists on steep mid and upper elevation northerly through easterly facing slopes. Human triggered slides 1-2' deep and 200' wide remain possible and may still be triggered from adjacent terrain or below. Be particularly alert to stiff and stubborn wind drifts in the open exposed terrain. The safest and arguably best riding conditions remain on low angle terrain on the sheltered shady slopes.
January,02,2018,"The Avalanche Danger is MODERATE on steep, mid and upper elevation slopes facing northerly through easterly.   Large avalanches can still be triggered in isolated areas.  While the chance of triggering a slide has decreased, the size has not – the avalanche would be 1 to 2 feet deep and up to 200’ wide, failing on loose, sugary, faceted snow. 
Safer terrain can be found on slopes less steep than about 30 degrees, which are not below steeper terrain, such as meadows and rolling, low angle terrain."
January,01,2018,"The Avalanche Danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep, mid and upper elevation slopes facing northerly through easterly.   Here, avalanches 1 to 2 feet deep and up to 200’ wide can be triggered, failing on sugary, faceted snow.  Avalanches can still be triggered from a distance and from below.
Avoid avalanche terrain by heading to slopes less steep about 30 degrees, which are not below steeper terrain, such as meadows and rolling, low angle terrain.
As wind speeds pick up today, any sensitive drifts forming along the high ridgelines should be avoided."
December,31,2018,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations, MODERATE at mid elevations and LOW at low elevations. The avalanche problem to look for and avoid is wind slabs that formed during the last few days but these could be tricky because winds have blown from a few different directions. Some older, harder wind slabs could be covered by last night's new snow making them harder to identify."
December,30,2018,"The avalanche hazard will rise to CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation aspects facing north, east, and south as westerly winds increase throughout the day. Upper elevation westerly aspects, as well as all mid elevation aspects, have a MODERATE hazard. The primary avalanche hazard today will be fresh wind slabs, particularly as wind speeds increase in the early afternoon. Also watch for sensitive soft slabs and long-running sluffs in the new snow, especially as snowfall rates increase later this afternoon.
Practice safe travel protocol: Travel one at a time in avalanche terrain, keep your partner in sight and be in position to get to them quickly should there be an avalanche."
December,29,2018,"Pockets of MODERATE danger exist for steep wind drifted slopes. Human triggered avalanches are possible on many aspects but more pronounced at the upper elevations.  Sluffing is also possible with provocation in the steepest terrain where not wind affected. 


Safe travel protocol is key today: Travel one at a time in steep terrain, keep your partner in sight and be in position to get to them quickly should there be an avalanche."
December,28,2018,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist for steep wind drifted slopes. Human triggered avalanches are likely. These drifts will be more pronounced on steep north to west to south facing slopes in the upper elevations.

From our entire team at the Utah Avalanche Center, we wish you all a Very Merry Christmas!"
December,24,2018,"The avalanche hazard for the Ogden mountains is mostly LOW, with a MODERATE hazard at the upper elevations facing north,  through east,  then southeast for fresh wind slabs. Watch for rounded pillows of fresh drifts as well as cornices along upper elevation ridgelines. Also watch for sensitive storm snow, especially during the morning hours if snowfall rates increase."
December,23,2018,"It remains possible to trigger a slab of wind drifted snow today. Look for signs of wind loading which are areas with smooth rounded or pillowly looking snow. These are typically found downwind of slopes where the wind has scoured or removed snow.
For today the avalanche danger is MODERATE at upper elevations and LOW at mid and low elevations."
December,22,2018,"New snow and increased winds overnight have created heightened avalanche conditions on any slope with wind drifted snow. You can trigger slabs of wind drifted snow on these slopes making the avalanche danger MODERATE at upper elevations. To find good riding conditions and good stability, ride slopes not affected by the wind."
December,21,2018,"The avalanche danger is LOW and the snowpack is mostly stable.  But low danger doesn't mean no danger - avalanches can be triggered on isolated terrain features.  The most likely spot would be a steep slope with a recent drift of wind blown snow. As always, avoid being on or beneath any cornices along ridgelines. 
Travel one at a time in steep terrain, keep your partner in sight, and be in position to get to them quickly should there be an avalanche."
December,20,2018,"The avalanche danger is LOW, and the snowpack mostly stable. But Low danger doesn’t mean no danger - avalanches can be triggered on isolated terrain features - most likely a steep slope with a recent drift of wind blown snow.

Carry and practice with your beacon, shovel and probe. Travel one at a time in steep terrain, keep your partner in sight and be in position to get to them quickly should there be an avalanche."
December,19,2018,"There is a MODERATE danger for triggering a new or old wind slab or wind drift, which will be scattered throughout the mid and upper elevation terrain.



Out of the wind affected terrain, the avalanche danger is mostly LOW in the Ogden area mountains.  Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features.  As always, avoid being on or beneath large cornices along the ridge line."
December,18,2018,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW in the Ogden area mountains.  Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features.  As always, avoid being on or beneath large cornices along the ridgeline and take care to avoid any smooth and rounded hard wind slabs in steep terrain."
December,17,2018,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW but for isolated pockets of MODERATE for both old and developing wind slabs in upper elevations.  Look for and avoid any smooth, rounded, pillowy snow feature.  These may be hard wind slabs and stubborn but not impossible to release.  Cornices should be given a wide berth."
December,16,2018,"The avalanche hazard is Moderate for Wind Drifted Snow. Overnight, southerly winds have formed fresh drifts of wind blown snow & wind slabs.  These wind slabs will be most widespread along the upper elevation northerly ridge lines.  Otherwise the hazard is Low."
December,15,2018,"The avalanche hazard is Moderate for new wind drifts that formed overnight from the strong, southerly winds.   These will be most widespread along the upper elevation ridge lines.  Also, stay back from the edges of the cornices draped along some of upper elevation ridge lines.
Otherwise the hazard is Low."
December,14,2018,"The avalanche hazard is Moderate for new soft wind drifts that may form as the afternoon winds pick up.  It may still be possible to trigger a few of the old, harder wind drifts and stay way back from the edges of the large, sensitive cornices draped along some of upper elevation ridge lines.
Otherwise the hazard is Low."

December,12,2018,"It'll be a day of rising avalanche danger.  Many areas will start off with a LOW danger this morning.  By late morning, the danger will trend toward MODERATE for new and developing wind drifts and new snow avalanches.  Wind drifts will be more prominent on steep north to east to southeast facing slopes but also cross-loaded into gullies and couloirs...as well as other aspects."
December,11,2018,"Most terrain has an overall LOW avalanche danger.  Low danger, however, does not mean No danger.  Isolated pockets of stubborn hard slab may still exist in steep drifted terrain."
December,10,2018,"The Ogden area mountains have a LOW avalanche danger.  Even though avalanche conditions are generally safe, watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features where shallow wind drifts could produce small slab avalanches. These locations should be easy to see and avoid."
December,09,2018,"The Ogden area mountains have a LOW avalanche danger.  Cornices along the high ridge lines are very large, and could break beneath the weight of a person. While pockets of faceted snow exist near the ground on steep, upper elevations slopes, none have produced avalanches in the Ogden area mountains.  If you travel in steep terrain, only expose one person at a time, especially on steep, shady slopes."
December,08,2018,"The Ogden area mountains have a mostly LOW avalanche danger, but a low danger does not mean no danger.  The cornices along the high ridge lines are very large, and could break beneath the weight of a person.  Avoid any new small wind drifts that form as the southwesterly winds increase.  While pockets of faceted snow exist near the ground on steep, upper elevations slopes, none have produced avalanches in the Ogden area mountains yet.  Still, if you travel in steep terrain, only expose one person at a time, especially on steep, shady slopes."
December,07,2018,"The Ogden area mountains have a mostly LOW avalanche danger, but a low danger does not mean no danger.  Small avalanches could be triggered in isolated places – perhaps a wind drift along a high ridgeline, a sluff on a very steep, northerly facing slope or a slide releasing on the facets near the ground on an upper elevation, very shady slope.  Terrain that’s super steep or above cliffs, trees or gullies has higher consequences, even if you are caught in a small slide.  Carry and practice with your beacon, shovel and probe."
December,06,2018,"With fresh slabs of wind drifted snow present from yesterday's winds, the avalanche danger is MODERATE on most upper elevation slopes. All other areas have a LOW danger, but a low danger does not mean no danger."
December,05,2018,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  Localized areas of MODERATE danger, however, exists for new and developing drifts in steep wind exposed terrain.  Evaluate snow and terrain carefully today."
December,04,2018,Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  Isolated areas exist in the higher elevations with shallow wind drifts and minor sluffing in the low density snow.  Normal caution is advised.

The avalanche danger is LOW at low elevations.
The dense snow has created excellent travel and riding conditions on low-angled slopes."
November,29,2018,"Slopes at upper elevations that face N and NE are the ones that potentially harbor faceted layers that could produce avalanches today. If winds begin transporting and drifting snow this afternoon onto northerly facing slopes, the danger could increase. The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all upper elevation northerly and east facing slope. All other slopes have a LOW avalanche danger."
November,28,2018,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW in the Ogden area mountains.

March,29,2017,"By mid to late morning, the danger will rise toward CONSIDERABLE for wet loose and perhaps wet slab avalanches on east, then south, then westerly aspects.  Northeast and northwest aspects will also be susceptible to sun and heating.  Wet avalanche activity is a certainty and I expect to see decent wet debris piles beneath steep sustained terrain features as the wet avalanches run not fast but far as they entrain all the snow down to the underlying melt-freeze crusts.
Isolated pockets of wind slab may still be sensitive to human weight or cornice fall in steep upper elevation terrain.  And, last but not least, cornices and glide cracks should be avoided with care."
March,28,2017,"The avalanche danger will quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE this morning for wet loose avalanches on all steep mid and upper elevation slopes that face the sunny half of the compass. You'll find a MODERATE danger for storm slab avalanches on mid to upper elevation slopes that face the north half of the compass.
If you don't want to deal with avalanches today: it's simple. Stick to upper elevation north facing terrain that's less than 33 degrees in slope steepness. Avoid being on or underneath anything steep above or adjacent to you - do this and great power skiing awaits. Continue to avoid traveling below the large cornices and opening glide cracks."
March,27,2017,"The avalanche danger will increase to MODERATE on steep mid and upper elevation slopes of all aspects as the snow adds up today.

March,23,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today for triggering wet loose sluffs on steep slopes of all aspects and elevations.  Slides triggered in the newest snow will turn into wet sluffs as they travel downhill.    Gullies and couloirs of all aspects have the potential to produce the largest avalanches and debris piles, and should be avoided today, as should any new drifts of wind blown snow on steep slopes. 
Lower angle slopes at the upper elevations should have great turning and riding conditions in the new dense soft snow."
March,22,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today for triggering wet loose sluffs on steep slopes of all aspects and elevations. Wet sluffs can even be triggered in the new wet snow at the upper elevations.

Signs of instability like dampening snow and rollerballs are signs to avoid steep slopes as well as the run out zones below."
March,10,2017,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE AND POSSIBLY CONSIDERABLE for wet loose sluffs today. Wet activity will occur first on east then south then west facing slopes as well as mid and low elevation north facing slopes. As the temperature increases, natural wet loose avalanches might occur  - when you experience signs of instability like dampening snow and rollerballs, it'll be time to avoid steep slopes and the run out zones below."
March,09,2017,"This morning:  the avalanche danger is generally LOW, with a MODERATE danger at the upper elevations for triggering a wind drift or cornice that could take you for a ride.
By late morning through the day:  the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE for wet loose sluffs, first on east then south then west facing slopes and on all low and mid elevation slopes. Natural wet loose avalanches might occur  - avoid steep sunny slopes and the run out zones below - like the bottoms of gullies and avalanche paths."

By late morning through the day:  the avalanche danger could rise to MODERATE for wet loose sluffs if and when the sun comes out, first on east then south then west facing slopes and on all low elevation slopes."
March,07,2017,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist for wind slabs on wind drifted slopes.  Keep in mind that the drifts may be up to 24"" deep and not limited to the usual locations.  The good news is that the best and safest riding conditions today can be found in wind-sheltered terrain."
March,06,2017,"It's a pretty simple recipe for today: the hazard is Considerable for wind drifts at the mid and upper elevations where you can expect to find sensitive fresh drifts on all aspects. Continued windy conditions maintain this hazard throughout the day. There is a Moderate hazard for triggering an avalanche within the storm snow, and although this hazard will decrease as the day progresses, localized snow showers may create isolated sensitive storm snow conditions during any period of high precipitation.
The best and safest riding conditions today can be found in wind-sheltered terrain."
March,05,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today for increasingly widespread hard wind drifts that can be triggered by a person. The wind slabs will be most widespread on mid and upper elevation slopes, especially those facing northwest through easterly. LOWER danger terrain would be wind sheltered, shady slopes at the mid and upper elevations, with no steep wind drifted slopes above you.

As the cold front arrives around the dinner hour we will have an increasing avalanche danger and by late this evening we will likely be at CONSIDERABLE or even HIGH danger as expected snowfall rates could reach 2-3"" per hour overnight."
March,04,2017,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW but will again rise to MODERATE on all steep sunlit slopes with daytime warming. The steep east to south to west facing terrain is to be avoided by the time it becomes damp and unstable, usually in the mid-morning to mid-afternoon hours. Cornices are still huge - take particular care along and beneath cornice-littered ridgelines."

The steep east to south to west facing terrain is to be avoided by the time it becomes damp and unstable, usually in the mid-morning to mid-afternoon hours.  Pockets of MODERATE exist for lingering wind slabs in steep exposed alpine terrain.  Cornices are still gargantuan and unruly - take particular care along and beneath cornice-littered ridgelines."

The steep east to south to west facing terrain is to be avoided by the time it becomes damp and unstable, usually in the mid-morning to mid-afternoon hours.  Pockets of MODERATE exist for lingering wind drifts in the steep exposed alpine terrain.  Cornices have become gargantuan and unruly - take particular care along and beneath cornice-littered ridgelines."
March,01,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE for wind drifts at the mid and upper elevations.  Human triggered avalanches are probable and most pronounced on steep north to east to south facing slopes...though terrain channeling of the winds will make many aspects suspect, particularly off the exposed ridgelines.   Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making will be essential today."
February,28,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE for wind slabs at upper elevation wind loaded slopes. Lots of low density snow is available for transport and will create dangerous avalanche conditions this morning and afternoon as the winds increase. Out of the wind and at mid to low elevations you'll find a MODERATE avalanche danger for loose dry and soft storm slab avalanches. Cornices are huge and will break back further than expected.
IF THE WINDS PICK UP WHERE YOU ARE, THE AVALANCHE DANGER WILL INSTANTLY RISE TO CONSIDERABLE. Quickly get out of the wind drifted terrain by heading to a lower elevation or a different aspect."
February,27,2017,"With plentiful new snow and strong SW winds, the avalanche danger this morning is CONSIDERABLE mainly for wind slab avalanches at mid and upper elevations. As the new snow rapidly accumulates, storm slab avalanches may be triggered even on wind sheltered slopes. Some naturally occurring avalanches will be possible later this morning with intense snowfall and continued strong winds."
February,26,2017,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW this morning, but will quickly increase to MODERATE as winds pick up this afternoon, and could reach CONSIDERABLE along the highest ridge lines by evening.  Once the fresh wind drifts start to form, stay off of and out from under steep wind drifted slopes.  Finish your powder day on wind-sheltered slopes."
February,25,2017,"This morning, the avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep slopes of all elevations and aspects, where long running sluffs can be triggered.   At the mid and upper elevations, there is also a MODERATE danger of triggering an old or newer wind drift.  Cornices are huge and will break back further than expected.
IF THE WINDS PICK UP WHERE YOU ARE, THE AVALANCHE DANGER WILL INSTANTLY RISE TO CONSIDERABLE on and below steep wind drifted slopes, most likely occuring at the upper elevations.  Quickly get out of the wind drifted terrain by heading to a lower elevation or a different aspect."
February,24,2017,"The danger is CONSIDERABLE today for soft slabs and loose long running dry snow sluffs. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding and conservative decision making are essential tools in the backcountry today. Remember that avalanche terrain includes runout zones beneath steep terrain. Avoid being underneath steep slopes loaded with new snow. 
Low density snow is world class on low angle slopes. Resorts have 5 star conditions as well."
February,23,2017,"The danger is CONSIDERABLE today for soft wind drifts and all-but-certain long running sluffs in the low density snow. These will be big enough to catch, carry, and bury a person today.  The danger may spike to HIGH during periods of high snowfall rates or if the winds become unreasonable and gusty.  Remember that avalanche terrain includes runout zones beneath steep terrain.  
HOT TIP! - Low density snow is still world class on low angle slopes."
February,22,2017,"We start out MODERATE for new snow avalanches on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations.  Human triggered soft slab avalanches and sluffs are possible on slopes 35° and steeper.  Stability should increase over the course of the day as the snow becomes less reactive; however this premise rests upon a lack of wind.  SAFE travel protocol is required for today: make a plan, communicate, get out of the way at the bottom.  Be aware of parties above or below.  
 IF the winds pick up midday into the afternoon ahead of the next wave of snow, the danger will remain at or even exceed MODERATE."
February,21,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep, wind drifted upper and mid elevation slopes.  Natural avalanches could occur and hard wind drifts triggered by a person are likely.  The wind drifts will be most widespread on mid and upper elevation northwest through north through easterly facing slopes. Cornices are growing and can break back further than expected.
At the mid and low elevations, the avalanche danger is MODERATE for triggering wind drifts or wet loose sluffs."
February,20,2017,"The avalanche danger is rapidly rising to CONSIDERABLE as the wind blows the snow into sensitive drifts. These wind drifts will be easily triggered by a person, and most widespread on upper elevation northwest through north through easterly facing slopes. Cornices are growing and can break back further than expected.
Out of the wind-affected terrain, the avalanche danger is MODERATE for triggering smaller new snow slides and MODERATE at the mid and low elevations for wet loose sluffs."
February,19,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevation northwest through east facing terrain where wind has deposited new snow creating dangerous avalanche conditions. The avalanche danger is Moderate on all mid elevation slopes for wind slabs and storm snow avalanches. The biggest concern will be upper elevation northerly facing terrain where wind has deposited new snow over weak faceted snow, forming a slab. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making is essential."
February,18,2017,"There is a MODERATE danger of wind slab avalanches in north facing, upper elevation terrain. Fresh deposits of wind drifted snow may be shallow and isolated, but could be sensitive to human provocation. Otherwise there is generally a LOW avalanche danger in the Ogden area mountains.
Remember that your choice of terrain will either amplify or minimize the overall risk of incident."
February,17,2017,"There is a mostly LOW avalanche danger in the Ogden area mountains. Wet and dry sluffs in the surface snow are possible in steep terrain. Fresh deposits of wind drifted snow may be shallow and isolated, but could be sensitive to human provocation.

Remember that your choice of terrain will either amplify or minimize the overall risk of incident."
February,16,2017,"We have a mostly LOW avalanche danger. Wet and dry sluffs in the surface snow are possible in steep terrain. Fresh deposits of wind slab may be shallow and isolated, but sensitive to human provocation. Remember that your choice of terrain will either amplify or minimize the overall risk of incident."
February,15,2017,Areas of MODERATE danger exist for longer running dry sluffs in the weakening surface snow on the northerly aspects.  The danger on the sunny aspects will also rise to MODERATE with daytime warming . Remember that your choice of terrain will either amplify or minimize the overall risk of incident.
February,14,2017,Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE with loose wet avalanche possible on southerly slopes and loose dry snow avalanches possible on the northerly slopes. Fortunately these slides are generally predictable and small.
February,13,2017,"The avalanche danger today is MODERATE. On southerly aspects, expect loose wet snow avalanches as the day warms. On other aspects with good powder, there are several problems to watch for and produced many shallow avalanches yesterday.
One problem that is not predictable is massive cornices found along ridgelines. Avoid being under or near these monsters which break in surprising places and further back that you'd expect."
February,12,2017,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW this morning, but will rise to MODERATE by afternoon on steep, sunny slopes for wet loose sluffs and on all low elevation slopes.  Be very alert for rapidly warming snow over short periods of time today and as you change elevations and aspects.  When the snow becomes damps where you are, move to lower angle terrain or a cooler aspect.
On steep upper elevation slopes, there remains a MODERATE danger of triggering a new snow slide or fresh wind drift. Cornices can break back further than expected."
February,11,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE this morning on mid and steep upper elevation slopes, where new storm snow slides can be triggered, especially any wind drifts.  The new snow should stabilize through out the day and become less sensitive.
The avalanche danger is also  MODERATE on on mid and low elevation slopes, where wet loose sluffs can be triggered on all aspects.  
I would avoid continuously steep terrain in the Ogden area mountains - a triggered new snow sluff will change to a wet sluff as it moves down hill, and become more powerful and larger than expected."
February,10,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE for wet loose and possibly wet slab avalanches on all aspects at the low to mid elevations.  Even damp rollerballs and wet sluffs may be expected with provocation on all but the highest northerly elevations. Un-Utah-like snowpack and weather warrants conservative decision making and cautious route finding in the backcountry today. 
Cornice-fall, roof and glide avalanches are all inherently dangerous...and all are quite possible today.  Ice climbing is not recommended."
February,09,2017,"The danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE for wet loose and possibly wet slab avalanches on all aspects at the low to mid elevations.  Even damp rollerballs and wet sluffs may be expected with provocation on all but the highest northerly elevations due to light rain and rapid warming.  These will be unusual conditions over the next 48+ hours.  Great uncertainty with these conditions warrants great caution.
Cornice-fall, Roof and Glide avalanches are all inherently dangerous...and all are quite possible today.  Ice climbing is not recommended."
February,08,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep slopes of all aspects and elevations.  There are dense wind drifts that can be triggered at the mid and upper elevations, and wet snow sluffs and slabs that will be easy to trigger on all aspects at the mid and lower elevations.
CONSIDERABLE means human triggered avalanches are likely on steep slopes.  Excellent terrain and route finding skills are needed for backcountry travel to avoid steep slopes on all aspects and elevations.
Many ice climbs in Little Cottonwood Canyon and Provo Canyon are directly in avalanche paths, and you could get hit from above as natural wet slides are still possible today."
February,07,2017,"The avalanche danger today is HIGH at upper elevations where fresh wind slabs can be easily triggered. The danger is CONSIDERABLE at mid to lower elevations. Travel in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. If you step out of bounds at a ski resort you're stepping into HIGH danger.
Many ice climbs are directly in avalanche paths from above. With increasing temperatures and rain up to 7500' it's best to avoid climbing in those areas."
February,06,2017,"The avalanche danger today is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations where fresh wind slabs can easily be triggered. The danger is MODERATE at mid to lower elevations. Dig into the snow to look for weak layers that can cause persistent slab avalanches, and watch for loose, wet snow avalanches at the lowest elevations."
February,05,2017,"A MODERATE danger exists for lingering wind drifts at the mid and upper elevations.  Wet avalanche activity will also rise to MODERATE on the steep sunlit slopes and low elevations of all aspects with daytime warming.  Creaky old cornices along the ridgelines should be avoided with great caution.  
Remember safe travel protocols save lives: make a plan, ski and ride one at a time, get out of the way at the bottom.  Ask yourself: what will happen if I trigger even a small avalanche in this terrain below?"
February,04,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep, wind drifted, upper and mid elevation slopes. Avoid steep slopes in exposed terrain where moderate winds combined with moderate snowfall have and will continue to develop wind slabs. Watch for wet avalanche activity on steep slopes at lower elevations on all aspects."
February,03,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep, wind drifted, upper and mid elevation slopes. Avoid steep slopes in exposed terrain where moderate winds combined with moderate snowfall have and will continue to develop wind slabs. With rain levels forecast up to 6500' today, watch for wet avalanche activity on steep slopes at lower elevations on all aspects."
February,02,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep wind drifted, upper elevation slopes, with the drifts most widespread on northwest through easterly facing slopes.  The avalanche danger is also MODERATE on mid and low elevations slopes facing northwest through east where slab avalanches up to 2 feet deep can be triggered failing on a buried layer of surface hoar.  Faceted weak layers also exist on other aspects and elevations, but are more isolated."
February,01,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on wind drifted, upper elevation slopes, and the drifts will be most widespread on northwest through easterly facing slopes.  The avalanche danger is also an isolated MODERATE on mid and low elevations slopes facing northwest through east where slab avalanches up to 2 feet deep can be triggered failing on a buried layer of surface hoar.  Small wet loose sluffs can be triggered if the snow becomes damp where you are."
January,31,2017,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE. The most dangerous and unpredictable avalanche problem is at low and mid elevations where you could still trigger a persistent slab avalanche. At the highest elevations watch for wind slabs, and as the day heats, watch for wet loose avalanches on the southerly aspects."
January,30,2017,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE. The most dangerous problem at low and mid elevations is persistent slab avalanches but these are not an issue on all slopes. Where this problem exists, there's a good chance you can trigger a slide. At the highest elevations watch for wind slabs, and as the day heats, watch for wet loose avalanches on southerly slopes."
January,29,2017,The avalanche danger today is MODERATE on all aspects and elevations.  The danger for wet snow avalanches will rise to MODERATE with daytime warming.  Human triggered avalanches are possible on many steep slopes today...and may be triggered from a distance.
January,28,2017,The avalanche danger today is MODERATE. Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully as human triggered avalanches are possible. Persistent slabs failing 2-4 feet deep are still a concern as well as wet activity on southerly facing slopes as daytime heating occurs.
January,27,2017,"The avalanche danger today is MODERATE. Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully as human triggered avalanches are possible. Watch for avalanches on low elevation steep slopes especially near gullies, creeks and terrain traps where even a small avalanche can create a deep debris pile."
January,26,2017,"The avalanche danger today is CONSIDERABLE which requires careful snowpack evaluations. Mid and low elevation slopes that seem safe may be the most dangerous because they have a layer of surface hoar or small faceted crystals buried 2-4 feet deep. This layer is widespread in the Ogden area. It can even produce avalanches on steep slopes near creeks, gullies and other terrain traps where a small avalanche can create a deep debris pile."
January,25,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all steep slopes in the Ogden area mountains, including low elevation slopes. Avalanches 2 to 4 feet deep can be triggered, both on slopes and remotely from a distance.  Careful snow pack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision making are essential for the backcoutnry traveler in avalanche terrain today.
There is unusually weak snow at the lower elevations – avalanches can be triggered below 7000’.  Avoid steep slopes and terrain traps such as gullies, creek beds, and trails and roads below steep banks where even a small slide can pile snow up deeply."
January,24,2017,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on all aspects and elevations. TRAVEL IN AVALANCHE TERRAIN IS NOT RECOMMENDED. You need stay off of and out from under steep terrain, and avoid avalanche runout zones.  If you are stepping out of bounds at a resort, you are stepping into HIGH danger.
What is unusual today is the weak snow at the lower elevations.  While avalanches may be smaller at low elevations, debris can still pile up dangerously deep in terrain traps such as gullies, creek beds, and below steep road banks. Today is not the day to walk or travel below any avalanche terrain."
January,23,2017,"The avalanche danger is HIGH at all elevations in the Ogden area mountains. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended – you need stay off of and out from under steep terrain, and avoid avalanche runout zones.
What is unusual today is the weak snow at the lower elevations.  While avalanches may be smaller at low elevations, debris can still pile dangerously deep terrain traps such as gullies, creek beds, and below steep road banks.  Avoid the low elevation trails and terrain, in addition to mid and upper elevation terrain."
January,22,2017,"A rising CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists for new and old wind slabs at the mid and upper elevations.  They'll be predominantly found on steep north to east to south facing slopes and up to 2' deep.  Lingering storm snow avalanches may also be triggered with provocation on all aspects and elevations.  Cornices should be approached with caution or not at all.  Sluffing will still be possible in the steepest terrain on all aspects.  
With additional snow and wind, I expect the danger to rise toward HIGH overnight and into tomorrow."
January,21,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE and heightened avalanche conditions exist on steep wind-drifted upper and mid elevation slopes. Loose, long-running sluffs entraining light new snow are likely in steep terrain. Snow and strengthening west-northwest winds will cause the avalanche danger to rise and become more widespread today.  Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully and avoid steep drifted slopes."
January,20,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep wind-drifted upper and mid elevation slopes. These shallow drifts might be hidden with a light covering of new snow making them hard to detect. Out of the wind-affected terrain, the avalanche danger is generally LOW. As always, even a small avalanche can have bad consequences if you are in steep terrain."
January,19,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep wind drifted upper elevation slopes, and MODERATE on wind drifted mid elevation slopes, too.   These shallow new drifts will be cracky, and can be triggered from a distance. Out of the wind affected terrain, the avalanche danger is generally LOW, though larger dry sluffs can be triggered on steep shady slopes.  As always, even a small avalanche can have bad consequences if you are in extreme terrain."
January,18,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW on all aspects and elevations, and today is a great one to be in the mountains with warm temperatures and light winds. Avalanche conditions are generally safe, but avalanches are possible in isolated areas."
January,17,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep mid elevation aspects around the compass. Where there is a possibility of triggering a deep slide, failing just above the December ice layer. At upper elevations you'll find a LOW avalanche danger, avoid pillows of rounded, smooth snow and be alert for cracking, indicating you have found a drift. Huge cornices are still sensitive and breaking back further than expected."
January,16,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep wind drifted upper elevation slopes where new wind drifts will form today.  Avoid pillows of rounded, smooth snow and be alert for cracking, indicating you have found a drift.  The huge cornices are still sensitive and breaking back further than expected.  There is also a MODERATE danger of triggering a deep slide at the mid and lower elevations, failing just above the December ice layer."
January,15,2017,"The danger will rise to MODERATE  on the steep sunlit slopes today with daytime warming.  A low-probability high consequence Moderate danger exists at the mid to low elevations for triggering a potentially unsurvivable 2-4' deep avalanche below 7500' in elevation.  Triggering a stabilizing storm slab is unlikely but not impossible with heavy loads (cornices, sluffs, a falling skier). Use extreme caution traveling along the heavily corniced ridgelines and continue to use safe travel protocol: make a plan, one at a time in steep terrain, get out of the way at the bottom. Sluffing in the cold dry snow is increasingly possible in steep northerly terrain.
Please communicate with other parties and try to avoid being above or beneath others in our very crowded Wasatch Range."
January,14,2017,The avalanche danger is MODERATE. Heightened avalanche conditions exist on slopes steeper than about 30 degrees so evaluate the snow and terrain carefully. Human triggered avalanches are possible on slopes where the snowpack is still adjusting to the added weight of this week's storm.
January,13,2017,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE, particularly for persistent slab avalanches in low and mid elevation terrain. Dangerous avalanche conditions exist - careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding and conservative decision making are essential for safe travel today."
January,12,2017,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on steep upper elevation slopes where wind drifts, cornices and new snow avalanches can be easily triggered by a person.  The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on mid and low elevation slopes.  Natural avalanches may occur this afternoon if we get a period of heavy snowfall.  Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.
If you do venture into the backcountry, you need expert snowpack and terrain evaluation skills and conservative decision-making.  Look at a map, measure your slope angles and stay off of and out from under slopes steeper than about 30 degrees.  Low angle turning and riding is fast, so you can still have fun out of the steep avalanche terrain."
January,11,2017,"There is an avalanche warning today with strong winds and snowfall expected throughout the day. The avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and upper elevations, and CONSIDERABLE at lower elevations. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended today.
For those that need to safely remedy their powder fever, Ogden Valley skiers and riders are blessed with world-class resorts with cracker-jack snow safety teams.
For those that choose to venture into the backcountry today, avoid travel on and below slopes steeper than 30 degrees, and avoid avalanche runout zones. Pay attention to rapidly changing avalanche and weather conditions. Days such as today often remind me of what my mentor Tom Kimbrough once said: ""Everyone knew you were an avalanche expert, except the avalanche."""
January,10,2017,"More avalanches will occur today and the avalanche danger is rated HIGH at the upper elevations, and CONSIDERABLE at mid and low elevations.  Natural avalanches are likely, and human triggered slides very likely.   The avalanche danger will continue to INCREASE later today and tonight with additional heavy snow and continuing strong winds.  Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended."
January,09,2017,"More avalanches will occur today and the avalanche danger is rated HIGH at the upper elevations. The danger is CONSIDERABLE at mid elevations. At mid and low elevations, both loose wet and persistent slab avalanches are possible."
January,08,2017,"The danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE with wind and storm slabs up high and wet loose avalanches down low. ​It may reach HIGH by the afternoon/evening.  It will be a day of rapidly changing conditions where caution needs to be the name of the game.  Natural and human triggered wet sluffs are expected with rain on snow by the early afternoon.  Roof slides, avalanches above the ice climbing gullies, and good debris piles of wet debris in creek beds and other terrain traps are expected.  
Many areas have LOW avalanche danger:  Safe and 5 star riding may be found on sun and wind-sheltered mid-elevation terrain on slopes less than 30°."
January,07,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE. Heightened avalanche conditions exist for wind slabs, loose dry snow and persistent slab avalanches. Human triggered avalanches are possible in steep terrain. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Re-evaluate your route when you encounter signs of instability like cracking, collapsing or recent avalanches. 
Special note: With forecast warming temperatures and rain in the next few days, pay very close attention to snow and ice falling from roofs. We received a ton of snow this week that is currently locked in place with the frigid air. Once the warm front moves into the area, a massive meltdown will occur. Do not stand, work, park your car or let your kids or pets play anywhere near where snow and ice could fall from above. These types of ""avalanches"" create deep piles quickly, can cause serious injury and, perhaps, even be fatal.

January,03,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today on steep, wind drifted slopes at the mid and upper elevations.  MODERATE means human triggered slides are possible.  If winds speeds increase where you are, the avalanche danger will also increase on the wind-drifted slopes.  Out of the wind-affected terrain, the avalanche danger will remain LOW to MODERATE.   The most likely place to trigger a shallow new snow slab or sluff would be on a steep, northwest through easterly facing slope. 
If you head through a gate or out-of-bounds from a ski resort, you are in the backcountry and in avalanche terrain.

Natural and human triggered avalanches are likely at the upper and mid elevations on northwest through easterly facing slopes.  Avalanches can be triggered remotely from a distance and from below.  Avoid travel on and below all steep slopes, including even the smaller, steep gullies, creek beds and road banks at the lower elevations.
Avoid avalanche terrain by heading to slopes less steep about 30 degrees, which are not adjacent to or below steeper terrain, such as meadows and rolling, low angle terrain"
December,25,2017,"AVALANCHE WARNING - The avalanche danger is HIGH today – backcountry travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.  Natural and human triggered avalanches are likely.  Avalanches can be triggered remotely from a distance and from below.  Avoid travel on and below all steep slopes, including even the smaller, steep gullies, creek beds and road banks at the lower elevations."
December,24,2017,"Today there is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on all upper elevation terrain for wind slab and persistent slab avalanches. These dangerous avalanche condition require careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision-making skills. Natural avalanches are possible and human triggered avalanches likely. Avoid being on, adjacent or under steep slopes as avalanches can be triggered from a distance. 
At mid elevations the danger will be MODERATE. Even in wind sheltered terrain, storm slab avalanches may be possible because the new snow is landing on a very weak snow pack. The best and safest riding will be found on low angle terrain (less than 30 degrees) with nothing steep above or adjacent to you."
December,23,2017,Today the avalanche danger is rising to CONSIDERABLE at the upper elevations on wind loaded slopes. A MODERATE danger will exist on mid elevation slopes where there is any wind loading or where the new snow is resting on old snow that became weak and faceted. This storm will help build the snowpack but it remains thin and hitting rocks or having an avalanche drag you into rocks remains a major hazard.
December,22,2017,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, but a MODERATE hazard exists in wind-loaded terrain along the upper ridgelines. Increasing winds today may create fresh wind drifts, so it is important to evaluate the snow and terrain carefully, and watch for changing conditions.
Very thin snow cover exists across the zone so even getting caught in a small avalanche could drag you over rocks, stumps and other barely-buried hazards."
December,21,2017,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE and heightened avalanche conditions exist on high elevation slopes facing the north part of the compass that hold freshly wind drifted snow. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Human triggered avalanches are possible as strong winds yesterday moved and packed snow into smoothed out starting zones. Avoid steep, leeward slopes that look or feel chalky or hollow to avoid this problem today. You might also encounter loose dry sluffs in steep, sheltered terrain where new snow accumulated on top of existing weak, sugary snow.
Avalanche danger is generally LOW on mid and low elevation slopes. 
Very thin snow cover exists across the zone so even getting caught in a small avalanche could drag you over rocks, stumps and other barely buried hazards."
December,20,2017,"As the storm moves in today, the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE and heightened avalanche conditions will exist. Human triggered avalanches will be possible as strong southwest winds and moderate snowfall will form wind slabs in high elevation terrain facing northwest through east today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully - avoid steep slopes with freshly wind drifted snow.
Loose dry snow avalanches and storm slabs will also be possible in sheltered high elevation terrain as new snow lands on the weak existing surface snow. If we experience stronger winds or more than expected snowfall, there is a chance the danger will rise to Considerable with the potential for natural avalanche activity. 
Very thin snow cover exists across the zone so even getting caught in a small avalanche could drag you over rocks, stumps and other barely buried hazards."
December,19,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW – but small avalanches can be triggered in isolated areas or extreme terrain.  The most likely avalanche to trigger would be a small, old shallow wind drift at the highest elevations.
The snow pack is very shallow - riding is really only possible at the upper elevations in the Ogden area mountains, and even there, staying on lower angle, grassy slopes or sticking to snow packed roads will reduce the number of rocks and stumps you hit."

December,16,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW – but small avalanches can be triggered in isolated areas or extreme terrain.  The most likely avalanche to trigger this afternoon (if it snows) would be a new snow sluff on an upper elevation slope facing northwest through northeast or a small, shallow wind drift at the highest elevations.
The snow pack is very shallow - riding is really only possible at the upper elevations in the Ogden area mountains, and even there, staying on lower angle, grassy slopes or sticking to snow packed roads will reduce the number of rocks and stumps you hit."
December,15,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Generally safe avalanche conditions. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features, mostly confined to upper elevation north and east facing slopes that recieved fresh drifts of wind blown snow from yesterday's bump in wind speeds."
December,14,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Generally safe avalanche conditions. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features, mostly confined to upper elevation north and east facing slopes that recieved fresh drifts of wind blown snow from yesterday's bump in wind speeds."
December,13,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Generally safe avalanche conditions. Watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features, mostly confined to upper elevation north and east facing slopes that recieved wind drifted snow from the wind event last Thursday December 7th. 
Utah Department of Trasportation has two backcountry closures in effect this morning. One in Big Cottonwood Canyon and the other is in Provo Canyon - click here for more details."
December,12,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Small slides are unlikely but could be triggered in isolated areas, mostly upper elevation northerly slopes and some east facing slopes that received wind drifted snow last Thursday."
December,11,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Small slides are unlikely but could be triggered in isolated areas, mostly upper elevation northerly slopes and some east facing slopes that received wind drifted snow last Thursday."
December,10,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW. Small slides are unlikely but could be triggered in isolated areas, mostly upper elevation northerly slopes and some east facing slopes that received wind drifted snow last Thursday."
December,09,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW – but small avalanches can be triggered in isolated areas or extreme terrain, most likely on an upper elevation slope facing northwest through east. Small wind slabs, shallow sluffs or a small slide breaking a foot deep into older snow are possible, though unlikely, on steep slopes. Any ride will likely involve hitting damaging rocks or stumps. The snow pack is very shallow - riding on lower angle, grassy slopes will reduce the number of rocks and stumps you will hit."
December,08,2017,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on northwest through southeast facing slopes with the lingering possibility of triggering a small wind slab. On most other slopes the avalanche danger is LOW. 
Choose low angle slopes for the best and safest turning conditions. 
With limited terrain available for riding (low tide as some call it), take the time to practice with your rescue gear if you get out."
December,07,2017,"Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on northwest through southeast facing slopes with the lingering possibility of triggering a small wind slab. On most other slopes the avalanche danger is LOW. 
Choose low angle slopes for the best and safest turning conditions. 
With limited terrain available for riding (low tide as some call it), take the time to practice with your rescue gear if you get out."
December,06,2017,"Today with a isolated wind slabs and isolated pockets of faceted snow on the highest elevations (above 9000 ft), the avalanche danger is MODERATE on northerly facing slopes at upper elevations. On most other slopes there is hardly enough snow to ride and the avalanche danger is LOW. The dilemma is that slopes with the best coverage (a relative term), are ones most likely to harbor some faceted snow. Two options are to simply choose slopes less than 30 degrees in steepness to avoid avalanches, or dig into the snow and make sure no faceted layers exist.
With limited terrain available for riding (low tide as some call it), take the time to practice with your rescue gear if you get out."
December,05,2017,"Areas of MODERATE danger exist in steep, mid to upper elevation terrain.  The danger is most pronounced on wind drifted slopes facing north to east, generally above 9000'.  Expect to note or initiate some point-release sluffs in the recent low density snow on slopes approaching 40° and steeper.  As always, make a plan, go one at a time, and get out of the way at the bottom.  
Hot Tip!  The best conditions will also be the safest:  lower angle non-drifted terrain will be 5 star with the cold smoke on the underlying crusts."
December,04,2017,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exists in steep terrain this morning. Wind drifts and loose snow avalanches should be expected in all steep terrain holding previous snow (upper elevation northwest through northeast facing slopes). Shooting cracks and audible collapsing of the snowpack are immediate signs of potential avalanche danger.
Hot Tip: the best conditions will also be the safest: lower angle non-drifted terrain will be 5 star with the cold smoke on the underlying crusts."
December,03,2017,AVALANCHE DANGER MAY RISE SIGNIFICANTLY LATER TODAY AND MONDAY AS A STRONG COLD FRONT APPROACHES NORTHERN UTAH. This morning we have a LOW avalanche danger quickly rising to MODERATE by later this afternoon for wind slab avalanches. HUMAN TRIGGERED AVALANCHES ARE POSSIBLE. The greatest danger will be on upper elevation north through southeast facing slopes. Avoid being on or underneath slopes that are steeper than 35 degrees in slope steepness.
December,01,2017,"The avalanche danger is LOW at upper elevations that hold old, hard snow. You are more likely to get injured in a ""slide for life"" as the snow surface is firm and slick. Consider carrying an ice axe if you plan to travel on steep, snow covered terrain. ​Low danger does not mean no danger  - carry your beacon, shovel and probe and practice safe travel protocols. 
We will continue with intermittent advisories until we begin to receive more snow."
November,27,2017,"The avalanche hazard is LOW. A few sluffs are possible.  On the highest upper elevation northwest through northeast aspects in the Ogden area mountains, there could be lingering weak faceted snow in isolated places near the ground, which could create a very isolated persistent slab hazard. Remember - a low avalanche hazard doesn't mean no avalanches. 
We will continue with intermittent advisories until we begin to receive more snow."
November,26,2017,"The avalanche hazard is LOW. With a couple of possible small storms early this coming week, the hazard may elevate due to fresh storm snow as well as possible wind drifting. On the highest upper elevation northwest through northeast aspects in the Ogden area mountains, there could be lingering weak faceted snow in isolated places near the ground, which could create a persistent slab hazard. Remember - a low avalanche hazard doesn't mean no avalanches. 
We will continue with intermittent advisories until we begin to receive more snow."
November,23,2017,"Avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger is LOW. With recent rain and warm weather, the snow surface is mostly wet and the snowpack is only 1 foot deep at the most. Rocks and stumps are a hazard now as well. A low danger does NOT mean no danger - just that the odds of triggering an avalanche are really small.
We'll continue with intermittent advisories until more snow falls."
November,20,2017,"The danger is MODERATE for increasingly sensitive drifts on steep wind loaded terrain at the mid and upper elevations.
We'll update this advisory on Thanksgiving morning."
November,19,2017,The danger is generally LOW.  Wind drifts may be sensitive to human weight in isolated terrain along the highest elevations.  The steep sunny aspects may be damp and unstable with direct sun and warming.
November,18,2017,"With a decent shot of snow from this storm,  it may be possible to carefully get out on the snow on grassy slopes and smooth roads. There is a generally LOW avalanche danger, but the danger increases to MODERATE on steep,wind drifted upper elevation slopes facing northerly through easterly.  
Remember that each year we have early season close calls, accidents, and sometimes avalanche fatalities.  Montana has tragically suffered th e first avalanche fatality of the season on October 7th.  Remember that traumatic injury is also more prevalent in the early season owing to the thin snow coverage - tread lightly.  Lastly, one must treat the unopened ski area terrain as the backcountry as the avalanche teams have yet to do control work.  Please check in with them if you have any questions or about their uphill travel policies.  
We will have morning updates through the weekend with additional forecasts as conditions warrant."
November,17,2017,"With a decent shot of snow from this storm, you might find a few places to walk with your skis on. There is a generally LOW avalanche danger but be mindful of a couple things if you venture into steeper terrain today:

With additional snowfall and strong winds throughout the day, we could experience heightened avalanche conditions at higher elevations. Human-triggered avalanches might be possible especially on steep, wind-drifted slopes that harbored old, weak snow. ​
Weak, shallow snow exists under the new snow in higher elevation, N facing and shaded terrain. Best to avoid these areas. 
Avoid steep, freshly wind-drifted slopes.
Conditions can and will change rapidly. Follow safe travel protocols.

We will have morning updates starting tomorrow and through the weekend with additional forecasts as conditions warrant."
November,10,2017,"There really isn't enough snow for recreation in the Ogden area mountains.  But if you're out and about, keep your eye on the weakening, shallow snow.  Quite honestly, the more that melts, the better!  
A general thought for the future:  Remember that each year we have early season close calls, accidents, and sometimes avalanche fatalities.  Montana has tragically suffered the first avalanche fatality of the season on October 7th.  Remember that traumatic injury is also more prevalent in the early season owing to the thin snow coverage - tread lightly.  Lastly, one must treat the unopened ski area terrain as the backcountry as the avalanche teams have yet to do control work.  Please check in with them if you have any questions or about their uphill travel policies."
November,05,2017,"By now, I guess I should never be surprised at what folks will do in the mountains with such minimal coverage, but suffice to say, if there's enough snow to ride, there's enough snow to avalanche.  There may be just enough new snow to allow for shallow sluffs and isolated wind drifts in the highest, northerly facing terrain.  

Remember that each year we have early season close calls, accidents, and sometimes avalanche fatalities.  Montana has tragically suffered the first avalanche fatality of the season on October 7th.

April,10,2016,"For Sunday through Wednesday, the avalanche danger is LOW in the mornings, but will increase to MODERATE each day with daytime heating. Wet loose sluffs and wet slabs can be triggered, and the chances of both will slowly increase each day during this prolonged warm spell.  There is also an isolated chance of a glide avalanche releases and cornice falls through Wednesday. 
This is our last early morning forecast for the season – we will update this forecast as conditions change, with next forecast around Thursday.  However, we will continue to post your observations on a daily basis.  Your observations will become increasingly important to the backcountry community."
April,09,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today at the low and mid elevations in the Ogden area mountains, where wet loose sluffs could be triggered.   There is also an isolated chance of triggering a wet slab avalanche or having a glide avalanche release."
April,08,2016,"The avalanche hazard is LOW this morning, and may rise to MODERATE as the day heats up with loose, wet snow avalanches possible."
April,07,2016,Avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger this morning is LOW at all elevations and aspects. The snowpack has adjusted to warm temperatures the last few days by warming then refreezing. By afternoon the danger could rise to MODERATE as the snow melts and becomes wet.
April,06,2016,The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Move off of sunny slopes as they become damp.  These slopes may become somewhat unstable and produce minor wet loose avalanche activity putting them into the MODERATE avalanche danger category.
April,05,2016,"The avalanche danger is LOW today, but unstable snow could be found on isolated terrain features, especially this afternoon .  Even with the cooling temperatures, it may be possible to trigger an isolated wet loose sluff or wet slab avalanche.  Also identify and avoid cornices, fresh wind drifts and avoid travel below any open glide cracks.  If the snow heats where you are and becomes wet and sloppy, the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE."
April,04,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE this morning, but will rise to CONSIDERABLE danger with daytime heating.  Both human triggered and natural avalanches are possible on all aspects and elevations, including northerly facing slopes, as the snow heats.  Avoid travel on and below steep slopes once the snow heats up."
April,03,2016,"A LOW avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE and then CONSIDERABLE with daytime heating.  The rapid rise of avalanche danger will start on the east, then south, then westerly facing aspects...with all but high north getting into the game by midday.  Early starts and early exits are key this time of year.  You're asking for trouble if you are in or below the steepest sunlit aspects after the snow has become unsupportable.  Cornices may calve with the heating today."
April,02,2016,"A LOW avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE and then CONSIDERABLE with daytime heating.  The rapid rise of avalanche danger will start on the east, then south, then westerly facing aspects...with all but high north getting into the game by midday.  Early starts and early exits are key this time of year.  You're asking for trouble if you are in or below the steepest sunlit aspects after the snow has become unsupportable.  Cornices may calve with the heating today."
April,01,2016,"LOW hazard this morning, rising to MODERATE as the sun warms the snow surface. The change from Low to Moderate may occur very quickly - so be aware of rapidly changing conditions."
March,31,2016,"This morning the avalanche danger will be mostly LOW except at higher elevations on slopes loaded by today's increased NW winds where the danger is MODERATE. Additionally, the wet snow avalanche danger should rise to MODERATE this afternoon if some sunshine gets through this morning's cloudy skies."
March,30,2016,"The overall avalanche danger is on the high end of MODERATE today.  There is a good chance that someone will trigger a large enough avalanche to be dangerous.  With all the new snow, wet avalanche activity is also a legitimate concern.  Don't just go for your favorite big line right off the get go!!  You're going to need to think it through today.  Let the snow stability dictate your terrain choice."
March,29,2016,"The danger was HIGH overnight and I expect it to be CONSIDERABLE throughout the day.  Human triggered avalanches are probable on many slopes at the mid and upper elevations and may be most problematic and touchy on the steep west to north to east facing slopes.  Cornices and avalanches may run on approach.  Beware of unusual loading patterns from the southeast winds.
 I recommend a simple approach for today while things settle out - stick to sheltered slopes of 30° and less with nothing steeper above.  A beginner's mind is required."
March,28,2016,"The morning starts out generally Low but for isolated pockets of wind slab along the lee of ridgelines at the mid and upper elevations.  Keep an eye out for cracking or collapsing in any recent wind deposited snow.  There is a great deal of uncertainty with this type of storm system, so I'll hazard a guess of the danger rising to MODERATE for storm snow instabilities on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations with new drifting in the high northerly terrain. ."
March,27,2016,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, but will rapidly rise to MODERATE danger with daytime heating.  The snow on all aspects and elevations but high north will heat and become damp, and both human triggered and natural wet loose avalanches will be possible.  Avoid travel on and below steep, warming slopes."
March,26,2016,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW, with a MODERATE danger for triggering a wind slab, mostly likely in the high alpine terrain.  If the clouds thin or skies clear, the snow will rapidly heat and the danger of wet loose sluffs will increase to MODERATE.  It will be possible to trigger these wet loose sluffs on just about all aspects and elevations but high north."
March,25,2016,"The danger of triggering a wind drift is MODERATE today, particularly at the upper elevations where fresh wind drifts may be found on a variety of aspects. Outside of wind-affected terrain the hazard is LOW. If snowfall rates spike - particularly during the afternoon due to convective activity - the storm snow may quickly become sensitive."
March,24,2016,"The danger of loose, wet snow avalanches is MODERATE today mainly on southerly aspects but it depends strongly on cloud cover. More clouds mean less danger, more sun means more danger. Wind slabs formed during strong NW winds Tuesday night/Wednesday morning will make the danger MODERATE on wind loaded slopes at mid and upper elevations. Generally safe conditions and a LOW danger exists on slopes sheltered from the sun and wind where the best snow can be found as well."
March,23,2016,"It's time to back off.  The danger is CONSIDERABLE on all wind drifted slopes where human triggered avalanches may be 2-3' deep in exposed terrain.  The danger extends to the mid-elevation ridgelines and even mid-slope.  Cracking and collapsing are immediate indicators to seek lower angle terrain.  Drifts and cornices may run on approach.  Remember, if you're heading out of bounds from the ski resorts, you are stepping into CONSIDERABLE DANGER. 
Your best bet will be to seek out mid-elevation, mid-canyon 30° slopes well below treeline.  Ensure there's no steeper terrain above."
March,22,2016,"The danger will rise in lock-step with today's storm.  I'd expect an overall MODERATE danger with perhaps occasional spikes to CONSIDERABLE during times of higher snowfall rates or gusty winds.  Plan for longer running sluffs than usual and wind drifts in the high lee of ridges and terrain features.  The best and safest riding today will be on lower angle slopes.  
With actively moving snow today, be mindful of who's below you.  Be mindful of what terrain you're below."
March,21,2016,"There is MODERATE avalanche danger for triggering wet loose sluffs as the day heats up on just about all aspects and elevations. Get off steep slopes when the snow becomes wet and sloppy.  Also use Normal Caution as you travel through the backcountry - watch out for any new wind drifts, don’t hang out in terrain below glide cracks and avoid travel on and below cornices."
March,20,2016,"This morning the avalanche danger will start LOW on slopes at low and mid elevations. Watch for wind slabs at upper elevations where the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Also, the avalanche danger due to loose wet snow will rise to MODERATE as the morning heats up."
March,19,2016,"Today you can find generally safe avalanche conditions on many slopes. However there is a MODERATE avalanche danger on upper elevation slopes with wind slabs. Also, as the day progresses the danger will rise to MODERATE due to loose wet avalanches."
March,18,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today. The two primary concerns are (1) wind drifted snow at upper elevations, and (2) wet loose avalanches as the strong March sun warms the snow surface."
March,17,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE for triggering a wind drift on upper elevation slopes, especially those facing northwest through easterly.  The likelihood of triggering a drift increases with elevation, especially along ridge lines and the areas that recieved the most snow.   There is also a MODERATE danger for triggering wet loose snow sluffs as the snow heats on almost any aspect and elevation except high north facing.  Natural wet sluffs also possible if there is prolonged sun where you are."
March,16,2016,"Most upper and mid elevation terrain has a MODERATE avalanche danger today for triggering wind drifts. These wind drifts will be most common on northeast through southeasterly facing slopes.  Use careful evaluation to avoid wind drifted terrain, there is amazing powder on the safer lower angle and wind sheltered slopes.  Avoid the small portion of terrain along the highest ridge lines where the winds are stronger and the avalanche danger CONSIDERABLE.  Loose snow sluffs can also be triggered on steep slopes of any aspect."
March,15,2016,On upper elevation slopes the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE where you will find many fresh wind slabs that could be easy to trigger. At mid elevations the avalanche danger is MODERATE where you can still find some wind slabs.
March,14,2016,"The avalanche danger this morning will start at MODERATE but should rise to CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation, wind loaded slopes with forecasted heavy snowfall and strong W and SW winds."
March,13,2016,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  Minor wet avalanches may still be possible on a variety of aspects and elevations and perhaps more pronounced on mid-elevation northerly terrain.  Continue to give sagging cornices along the ridgelines a wide berth.  
With a significant storm on the doorstep, it'll be ""Game On"" tomorrow through mid-week.  Plan accordingly."
March,12,2016,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  Areas of MODERATE danger exist for wet loose avalanches on all aspects and perhaps more pronounced on the steep low to mid elevation northerly aspects.  Much depends on the cloud cover and the arrival of the forecasted cooler temps.  The danger will be self-evident, however-if you find yourself in poorly consolidated or unsupportable wet snow, move to low angle terrain and avoid being in or above terrain traps.  
Here's a cool new tutorial on the North American Danger Scale by the  Forest Service National Avalanche Center."
March,11,2016,"There is a MODERATE avalanche danger today for triggering new wind drifts, which will be most widespread on upper elevation slopes facing the north half of the compass.  With continued warm temperatures, the avalanche danger of triggering a wet loose sluff will also increase to MODERATE with daytime heating, especially at the mid and low elevations."
March,10,2016,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW early this morning, though wind drifts can still be triggered on upper elevation slopes facing north through southeast.  The avalanche danger will increase to MODERATE with heating today – wet loose sluffs will be easy to trigger, and natural slides are possible.  Avoid travel on and below steep sunny slopes once the snow heats up."
March,09,2016,The avalanche danger remains generally LOW in the majority of the backcountry terrain.  I hesitate to call it MODERATE on the steeper upper elevation ridgtop terrain but I suppose there may be minor human triggered avalanche activity.  Consider consequences of even a small slide if you are getting into the more unforgiving terrain.
March,08,2016,"We have a mostly LOW danger this morning.  Within a few hours, the danger will rise to MODERATE with sun and daytime heating.  This includes all elevations and aspects but high north. Any wet sluffs triggered in the low to mid elevation sheltered aspects may gouge more deeply in the poorly consolidated snowpack, producing a larger debris pile.  
Remember that risk is always inherent in mountain travel and terrain choices may amplify the consequences of even a minor avalanche."
March,07,2016,"A great deal of uncertainty accompanies this forecast. A MODERATE danger exists on all aspects and elevations due to wind drifts, storm snow instabilities, and perhaps particularly on the low to mid elevation northerly terrain hammered by rain yesterday.  It may be possible to gouge out some wet avalanches in poorly consolidated snow in steep terrain.  
Safer and probably better riding conditions can be found in the wind protected 8500'-9500' elevations on 30° slopes."
March,06,2016,"This morning the avalanche danger will be LOW but will rise to MODERATE when today's storm arrives. At low elevations rain may cause loose, wet snow avalanches. At mid and upper elevations, strong southerly winds and new snow will make wind slabs the main problem."
March,05,2016,"The avalanche danger today is LOW. In isolated areas watch for unstable snow which can be loose wet snow avalanches, glide avalanches, or falling cornices."
March,04,2016,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, but the chance of triggering small wet loose sluffs will increase as the day heats up.  Even with a Low Danger, avalanches can still happen in isolated places, and even a very small slide can have consequences in continuously steep terrain or above cliff bands."
March,03,2016,"The avalanche danger is LOW today. However, Low doesn't mean NO, so watch for small fresh wind drifts at upper elevations in addition to small, wet snow avalanches as temperatures rise today."
March,02,2016,Avalanche conditions remain about the same as on Tuesday.  The overall avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Watch for minor fresh drifts in the upper elevations if you are getting into unforgiving terrain.
March,01,2016,"The danger is LOW.  Remember that risk is always inherent in mountain travel.  While the danger for avalanches is low, keep in mind that your terrain selection may magnify the consequences of even a typically harmless sluff or wind pocket."
February,29,2016,"The danger is LOW.  Remember that risk is always inherent in mountain travel.  While the danger for avalanches is low, keep in mind that your terrain selection may magnify the consequences of even a typically harmless sluff or wind pocket."
February,28,2016,Today the avalanche danger is LOW.
February,27,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE this morning on west through southeast aspects that received the most sunshine yesterday. Very warm temperatures yesterday and the lack of a refreeze this morning will make loose wet snow avalanches possible, but cooler temperatures should decrease the danger of this problem throughout the day. North aspects that did not heat up as much yesterday have a LOW avalanche danger."
February,26,2016,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, and may rise to MODERATE on steeper solar aspects during the afternoon where wet, loose sluffs are possible.
In upper elevation extreme terrain you may find very manageable minor wind pockets and dry, loose sluffs."
February,25,2016,The avalanche danger is generally LOW.  Minor wind pockets and dry loose sluffs should only pose a problem in extreme terrain.  Human triggered wet sluffs are possible when riding and traveling through the steep sunlit aspects if and when they've become wet and unsupportable.
February,24,2016,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW in the majority of the terrain.  Rogue shallow soft slabs perhaps can be found again in very steep upper elevation terrain.  If wind speeds increase, anticipate the potential for fresh sensitive wind drifts.  Keep an eye on how today's warmer temperatures affect the snow and avoid steep terrain if it becomes too wet."
February,23,2016,The avalanche danger is generally LOW in the majority of the terrain.  Watch for minor sluffing and shallow fresh wind slabs which may release.  These won't pose a great threat unless you get caught and pushed over rocks or into trees.
February,22,2016,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, but will increase to MODERATE on steep, wind-drifted slopes this afternoon.  The MODERATE danger will be on upper elevation slopes approaching 35 degrees or steeper, where the new snow is getting blown into sensitive slabs by the northwesterly winds."
February,21,2016,"Most terrain enjoys a LOW avalanche danger today.  It depends on cloud cover, but I expect the danger to rise to MODERATE on all the steep sunlit slopes with daytime warming.  
 As a general rule, please avoid being in the steep terrain east of North Ogden Divide when it's possible to trigger long running slides."
February,20,2016,"Most terrain enjoys a LOW avalanche danger today.  Localized pockets of hard wind slab (accounting for the Moderate), however, may be susceptible to triggering on a wide variety of aspects at the mid and upper elevations.  These rounded pockets should be judged suspect, particularly if you're above terrain with ugly consequences."
February,19,2016,"A CONSIDERABLE avalanche hazard exists with the main concern being fresh wind drifts primarily at upper elevations, with more isolated pockets at mid elevations. Although I am not expecting winds to be all that strong during the day today, the southwest winds may create fresh wind slabs, particularly at the  upper elevations. Also be sure to watch for signs of wet loose avalanche activity as the day warms at all lower elevation aspects.
For those who simply don't want to mess in avalanche terrain today, stay on slopes less steep than 35 degrees and you will find safe, superb riding conditions."
February,18,2016,"At low elevations the wet snow avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE because of rain this morning. With fresh wind slabs present at mid and high elevations, the avalanche danger is MODERATE."
February,17,2016,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE today.  Heat related avalanche activity on the sunnier slopes is your main focus.  Get off of and out from underneath steep slopes as they become wet during the day.
February,16,2016,The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all steep slopes today.   Steep sunny slopes and all mid and lower elevation slopes have a MODERATE danger of wet loose sluffs as the day heats up.   It may also be possible to trigger a few lingering wind drifts on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through southeast.
February,15,2016,"The avalanche danger of triggering a wind drift on a steep slope is CONSIDERABLE today at the upper elevations, and MODERATE at the mid elevations.   Out of the wind drifted terrain, there is a MODERATE avalanche danger for triggering sluffs on steep slopes, storm slabs where the graupel has pooled beneath cliff bands and wet loose sluffs at the lower elevations. 
Best turning and riding will be on lower angled, more wind sheltered slopes where the dense snow has mostly filled in the old tracks."
February,14,2016,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  I do, however, expect we'll have areas of MODERATE danger for wind slabs in open, exposed terrain.  Cracking and collapsing are sure-fire indicators of localized instability.  If we see more snow than expected, loose dry sluffs will run with ease and abandon on the slick underlying crusts or recrystallized snow in the steepest terrain. 
Remember that your terrain choices magnify the overall risk.  They may also minimize the risk.  A small wind pocket on a test slope with a clean runout is quite different than that same small wind pocket above Sik-bird couloir or Trapdoor gulley."
February,13,2016,The avalanche danger is mostly low this morning. We have a Moderate danger on South (Solar) aspects due to wet loose avalanche problems this may rise to Considerable as these aspects start to heat up.  Be aware of cornices today.  Stay back give them room it has been over 48 hrs since they have seen a good freeze.
February,12,2016,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW this morning. A MODERATE danger remains at high elevations with a few weak layers in the snowpack that could produce an avalanche. Additionally, the danger will rise to MODERATE on south aspects due to a loose wet snow avalanche problem as things warm up."
February,11,2016,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW this morning. A MODERATE danger remains at high elevations with a few weak layers in the snowpack that could produce an avalanche. Additionally, the danger will rise to MODERATE on south aspects due to a loose wet snow avalanche problem as things warm up."
February,10,2016,The avalanche danger starts out mostly LOW this morning but will rise to MODERATE as the daytime heating starts.  Carefully monitor the sunny slopes you are on and what is above you watching for the snow to become damp and sloppy.
February,09,2016,"The avalanche danger is LOW in the morning, but will rapidly rise to MODERATE today for triggering wet, loose sluffs on steep, sunny slopes as the day heats up.  Natural wet loose slides will also occur, so also avoid travel below the steep sunny slopes once they heat. 
There are a variety of other avalanche concerns to be aware of and evaluate - including the chance of triggering old, hard wind slabs, and a slidle on one of the faceted weak layers, either mid pack or near the ground.  As always, evaluate all steep terrain carefully."
February,08,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep upper elevation slopes for triggering a wind drift.  The danger is also MODERATE for triggering a wet, loose sluff with daytime heating and strong sun - natural wet loose slides can also be expected, so also avoid travel below the steep sunny slopes once they heat. 
And finally, a MODERATE avalanche danger remains on steep, mid to upper elevation slopes facing west through north through east, where deep slides breaking near the ground can be triggered in shallower snowpack areas, especially slopes that have slid one or more times this year."
February,07,2016,"We have an overall MODERATE avalanche danger in the backcountry.  Watch for new and developing wind drifts along the high elevations.  Drifts may be also be loaded or crossloaded mid-slope.  The likelihood of triggering a deep slab avalanche is diminishing, but the consequences remain severe.  The wet avalanche activity may rise toward Considerable again today.  
I'm issuing a Soapbox Warning: if you're skiing or riding the steep south-facing terrain above the road with unstable wet avalanche conditions, you may very well trigger a slide across the road or onto others below.  Skinning, booting, or simply building jumps in the runout zones below at these times isn't helpful, either.  #BackcountryResponsibilityObjective    More to come on this..."
February,06,2016,"We have an overall MODERATE  avalanche danger in the backcountry.  Watch for new and developing wind drifts along the high elevations.  The likelihood of triggering a deep slab avalanche is diminishing, but the consequences remain severe.  Be mindful of how the sun and cloud cover affects the wet avalanche activity today."
February,05,2016,"Today the overall avalanche danger is MODERATE, and there are heightened avalanche conditions on any slope with wind slabs or drifts from early this week or on any slope with a thin snowpack and/or buried layers of faceted snow. Unfortunately it takes work to know which slopes have these heightened avalanche conditions. There are several options if you want to get into avalanche terrain - do some investigating and careful assessments, go to low elevation slopes which have a LOW avalanche danger, or simply roll the dice. Another great option is to choose low angle slopes and not worry about avalanches at all."
February,04,2016,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on any upper elevation slope with recently formed wind slabs or on any upper elevation slope facing NW through NE where a slide could break at the ground. Otherwise, a MODERATE danger exists on mid elevation slopes due to the possible presence of a few different weak faceted layers buried 1-2 feet deep."
February,03,2016,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep upper elevation slopes with new or old wind drifts.  The drifts will become more widespread today as the winds increase.  There is a MODERATE danger on upper and mid elevation slopes for triggering a slide on the buried surface hoar - the distribution of this layer remains uncertain.   There remains a pockety, or isolated, CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger on steep, upper elevations slopes facing northwest through northeast where a slide breaking near the ground could be triggered, especially slopes that have already slid this year.  
Safer terrain choices with good powder conditions include lower angle, wind sheltered slopes."
February,02,2016,The avalanche danger remains CONSIDERABLE in the upper elevations.  It's quite likely to trigger a fresh wind slab today on a variety of aspects in the higher terrain.  Wind transported snow has enhanced the chance for triggering an avalanche breaking into deeper weak layers although this is still a more of a remote possibility.
February,01,2016,The danger is CONSIDERABLE in steep wind drifted terrain and more pronounced on the north to west to south facing slopes.  The easterly winds result in unusual loading patterns and those that travel by rote may be surprised today. Sensitive wind drifts and long running natural sluffs should be prevalent in the steeper terrain of the mid and upper elevations.  Deep slab avalanches up to 3-5' deep remain low probability/high consequence issues on a variety of aspects at the mid and upper elevations.
January,31,2016,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation slopes, where new snow soft slabs in wind drifted terrain and sluffs can be triggered on slopes approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  If the winds increase where you are  today, the danger will increase rapidly.  There is a CONSIDERABLE danger on steep, upper elevation slopes were deep slides breaking near the ground can be triggered.
CONSIDERABLE means dangerous avalanche conditions - careful snow pack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision-making essential.  Human triggered avalanches are likely on steep slopes.
Safer terrain choices with superb snow conditions include lower angle, wind sheltered mid elevation terrain."
January,30,2016,"An Avalanche Warning has been issued for all the mountains of northern Utah.  The Avalanche Danger is HIGH on and below all upper and mid elevation slopes steeper than about 30 degrees.  Natural avalanches are probable today; avalanche run out zones should be avoided.
CONSIDERABLE Avalanche Danger on low elevation slopes, where wet snow avalanches could be triggered.  Avoid steep slopes and terrain traps like gullies, road banks and creek bottoms.
Many of the Utah ice climbs are in avalanche paths, below starting zones that could get heavily loaded with snow today."
January,29,2016,"The avalanche danger will be rising today with an approaching storm bringing heavy snowfall and strong winds. We have issued an Avalanche Watch because we expect very dangerous avalanche conditions to develop within the next 24 hours. For this morning however, the danger is mostly MODERATE due to buried weak layers, shallow wind slabs, and potentially loose wet snow at low elevations. At the highest elevations on NW though N through E aspects, a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists because many slopes in these places avalanched around the Solstice, have weak snow at the ground, and will likely slide again."
January,28,2016,"Today the avalanche danger remains CONSIDERABLE at the upper elevations on NW through N through E facing slopes where dangerous avalanche conditions exist. There are buried persistent weak layers of faceted snow which are tricky to assess but have been producing avalanches through much of January. Avalanches are the clearest sign of unstable conditions. Also watch for wet loose avalanches on more southerly facing slopes where the snow surface will become wet.
Safe terrain is any slope less than 30 degrees in steepness. Many of these low angle slopes have great coverage and great snow on sun and wind sheltered terrain."
January,27,2016,"The Avalanche Danger is CONSIDERABLE on all steep, upper elevation slopes facing northwest through southeast, that slid during the December avalanche cycle and are now filled back in with snow.  Other steep slopes have a MODERATE danger for triggering smaller wind drifts and sluffs , especially at the upper elevations.  
Avoid steep, sunny slopes facing east through south through west where the avalanche danger could rise as high as CONSIDERABLE once the snow dampens from sun and daytime heating.
Safer terrain includes lower angle, wind sheltered slopes."
January,26,2016,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist in the backcountry.  Avoid the steep sunny aspects with daytime heating.  These are unusual conditions and unusual avalanches occur during times like these.  A great deal of uncertainty accompanies this forecast as the snowpack is as complex and tricky as I can recall from the last few years.  What I do know is that with uncertainty, I step back from the edge and give a wide margin for error.  I also know that most accidents and fatalities occur during Considerable danger.  Backcountry Responsibility and Acceptable Risk - your gain, our loss.  If you trigger a slide today, will it cross the road or hit others below?"
January,25,2016,"We have a Considerable danger in the backcountry right now.  Human triggered sluffs and wind drifts are likely in steep terrain today.  It is still possible to trigger avalanches 2-3' deep into older faceted snow on a variety of aspects.  If we get more sun and heating that expected, the new snow may become more active in the steepest sun-kissed terrain.
The snowpack is complicated right now.  When I find that things start getting complicated, it's time to step back toward simplicity: slope angle and proper terrain analysis.  Give yourself a good margin for error."
January,24,2016,"The Avalanche Danger is HIGH on and below upper elevation slopes approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  Natural avalanches are occurring in the Salt Lake mountains as I type.  With continued snow and increasing winds in the forecast, the avalanche danger will remain HIGH throughout the day.  Avoid travel on and below steep slopes – backcountry travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended today.
Safer terrain:  we just filled in the old tracks again, so head back to the low angle, wind sheltered terrain, especially at the low to mid elevations, with no steep slopes above you."
January,23,2016,"The Avalanche Danger remains CONSIDERABLE on all steep, upper elevation slopes, especially those with new wind-drifts.  Cautious route finding and conservative decision-making are essential today.  Numerous close calls and avalanche fatalities in Utah and the western US this week emphasize the dangerous, complex snow pack and avalanche conditions. 
Low angle, powder filled terrain choices are abundant in the northern Utah mountains and provide a safer choice."
January,22,2016,Today the avalanche danger on upper elevation wind loaded slopes is CONSIDERABLE where triggering a fresh wind slab is likely. With a variety of avalnche problems at other elevations the avalanche danger is MODERATE.
January,21,2016,"There a many weak layers and issues that will cause avalanches today. All the red flags are present. Widespread recent avalanche activity both natural and human triggered, recent snow and strong winds, widespread faceted layers in the snowpack, and today will have strong sunshine and temperatures possibly going above freezing. All these factors combine to make very dangerous avalanche conditions and a HIGH avalanche danger."
January,20,2016,"The Avalanche Danger is HIGH today on upper elevation slopes, especially those that are steep and wind-drifted and slopes facing north through easterly. Avoid travel on and below these slopes, as natural avalanches are possible and avalanches can be triggered remotely.  Travel in and below steep avalanche terrain is not recommended today. 
Wind sheltered, lower angle terrain offers a safer choice for very experienced travelers, as long as there are no steep slopes above."
January,19,2016,"Most terrain has a MODERATE danger.  A MODERATE danger for avalanches in the new snow exists on nearly all aspects and elevations on slopes approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  Human triggered avalanches into deeper layers of the snowpack may be more likely on steep north to east facing slopes above 8000'.  Avoid being on or beneath steep sunlit terrain with daytime warming.  
Caveat!  Another storm is on the way tonight - if the southwest winds pick up earlier than anticipated, expect the danger to rise accordingly with additional wind drifting."
January,18,2016,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist in the upper elevation wind drifted terrain.  A MODERATE danger exists for mid elevation wind drifted terrain.  These issues are more pronounced on steep north to east to south facing slopes and may still be triggered at a distance or break well above you.  Wet avalanche activity may be found at the lower elevations.  Safer, better options include wind sheltered mid-elevation slopes less steep than 35 degrees."
January,17,2016,"Today with more snow and strong winds, the avalanche danger is HIGH on wind loaded, upper elevation slopes. A CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists on mid elevation slopes where a combination of wind loading or the presence of buried facets will create an avalanche. Below 7000 feet on low elevation slopes, there is less snow and less wind, but avalanches are still possible and the danger on these slopes is MODERATE."
January,16,2016,"Today the avalanche danger will be rising. On upper elevation, wind loaded slopes the avalanche danger will become HIGH. As winds load slopes human triggered avalanches will be likely and there should be some natural avalanches as well. Human triggered avalanches will also be likely on mid elevation slopes which have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger, especially ones shaded from the sun where the new snow rests on weak facets."
January,15,2016,"The Avalanche Danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep, wind-drifted slopes facing northwest through easterly at the upper elevations, above about 9,500’.   Avoid travel on and below wind-drifted slopes, where avalanches can be triggered remotely.  Other steep slopes have a MODERATE danger, and small loose sluffs will be easy to trigger on all aspects."
January,14,2016,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE today.  Diligently look for fresh drifts on a variety of aspects especially around ridges and terrain features.  Human triggered avalanches are likely but probably won't be all that large.  THE AVALANCHE DANGER WILL INCREASE AS WE ADD MORE NEW SNOW TONIGHT AND INTO FRIDAY.
January,13,2016,"Areas of MODERATE account for both wet and dry sluffs on the steeper sunny and shady slopes, respectively; shallow and pockety wind drifts along the exposed north to east facing slopes just off the ridgelines, and the off-chance of triggering a deep or persistent slab avalanche in steep, shallow northwest to easterly facing terrain.  
The best and safest terrain continues to be wind and sun sheltered slopes on slopes less steep than 35 degrees.  Continue your safe travel protocol: ride one at at time in steep terrain, make a plan, get out of the way at the bottom."
January,12,2016,"The danger remains at MODERATE in the backcountry for human triggered avalanches.  Avalanche problems can be found all over the compass today and are almost too many to mention: dry and wet loose snow avalanches, wind slabs, and persistent/deep slabs.  If this all sounds complicated, it's because it is right now.  Remember that your trump card is slope angle.  Your best bet is to find sun and wind sheltered terrain on slopes less steep than about 35 degrees with nothing steeper above."
January,11,2016,"The most dangerous terrain today will be the wind zone along the upper elevation ridge lines, where the Avalanche Danger could increase from MODERATE to CONSIDERABLE if the winds continue to blow strongly.  Avoid travel on and below steep wind drifted slopes. Out of the wind-affected terrain, the avalanche danger is mostly LOW, but:

Wet, loose sluffs will be easy to trigger on steep sunny slopes as the snow heats up.
There remain a few isolated places where a person could trigger a slide breaking to the ground, on mid and upper elevation slopes facing northwest through easterly."
January,10,2016,Today the avalanche danger is MODERATE on all upper elevation slopes and on mid elevation slopes facing NW->N->E where avalanches in the new snow are possible.
January,09,2016,The avalanche danger is MODERATE on mid to upper elevation slopes (above 8000 feet). The main thing to look for is the slightest evidence of wind drifted snow even though winds have been mostly calm. The presence of weak facets under the new snow means that slopes unaffected by the wind may also produce soft slab avalanches.
January,08,2016,"If the winds pick up, the Avalanche Danger will increase to CONSIDERABLE on any steep wind drifted slope. Out of the wind-affected terrain, the avalanche danger is MODERATE on all steep mid and upper elevations slopes, where a person can trigger new snow sluffs and soft slabs.  There also remain a few isolated places where a person could trigger a larger avalanche breaking to the ground.  Areas that recieved the lower snow amounts, with storm totals closer to 6"" of snow, have a lower general avalanche danger.
The safer, lower angle terrain provides excellent turning and riding conditions."
January,07,2016,"The Avalanche Danger is CONSIDERABLE on steep mid and upper elevation slopes of all aspects where the new snow is bonding poorly to the old snow surfaces - human triggered slides are likely and natural avalanches are possible.  It will be especially easy to trigger slides on wind-drifted slopes and slopes facing northwest through easterly.  In isolated places, a person could trigger a larger avalanche breaking to the ground.  There is a MODERATE danger of slides breaking near the ground in the old facets.  
Lower angle slopes have excellent turning and riding conditions in the dense snow, and are the go to terrain."
January,06,2016,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE.  Human triggered avalanches are possible from recent wind loads and or deep weak layers failing in shallow snowpack areas.  Accurate snowpack analysis and terrain selection are crucial.  The avalanche danger is less pronounced in the mid and lower elevations.
January,05,2016,"Areas of MODERATE danger exist in the backcountry for lingering wind drifts as well as for human triggered deep slab avalanches.  The danger is most pronounced on mid and upper elevation west to north to easterly facing slopes above about 8000'.  Excellent and safe soft settled powder may still be found in the wind sheltered northerly terrain below treeline on 30° slopes or less - and not connected to anything steeper above or adjacent to you.  
Follow and model safe travel protocol - make a plan, expose only one person at a time in suspect terrain, and get out of the way at the bottom."
January,04,2016,"A MODERATE danger exists in the backcountry for Friday's lingering wind drifts as well as for human triggered deep slab avalanches.  The danger is most pronounced on mid and upper elevation west to north to easterly facing slopes above about 8000'.  Excellent and safe soft settled powder may still be found in the wind sheltered northerly terrain below treeline on 30° slopes or less - and not connected to anything steeper above or adjacent to you.  
Many folks these days think that Moderate is the new Low.  It's not the case - it couldn't be further from the truth."
January,03,2016,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE today at upper elevation, wind-loaded slopes mainly facing E, N, and W where triggering a fresh wind slab or drift is likely and triggering a deep slab avalanche remains possible. The avalanche danger is MODERATE at middle elevations where triggering a wind slab or a deep slab avalanche is possible. Go to low elevation, wind sheltered slopes for a LOW avalanche danger."
January,02,2016,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE today at upper elevation, wind-loaded slopes where triggering a fresh wind slab or drift is likely and triggering a deep slab avalanche remains possible. The avalanche danger is MODERATE at middle elevations where triggering a wind slab or a deep slab avalanche is possible in specific terrain. Go to low elevation, wind sheltered slopes for a LOW avalanche danger."
January,01,2016,"The Avalanche Danger is MODERATE on mid and upper elevation slopes facing west through north through east that are steeper than about 35 degrees, where in isolated places a person could still trigger a large avalanche breaking to the ground.  Lower angle slopes and those that have slid offer safer choices.  There is also a MODERATE danger for triggering small new wind slab, especially along the higher ridge lines."
December,31,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation slopes for wind slabs. Heightened avalanche conditions exist so evaluate the snow and terrain carefully. 

The avalanche danger is LOW at mid and low elevations. LOW danger means that you still need to practice safe travel protocols and watch for unstable snow in isolated areas. Risk is inherent in mountain travel and low danger in no way means no danger."
December,30,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper and mid-elevation slopes for wind slabs and persistent slabs. Heightened avalanche conditions exist so evaluate the snow and terrain carefully. 

The avalanche danger is LOW at elevations below 7000 feet. LOW danger means that you still need to practice safe travel protocols and watch for unstable snow in isolated areas. Don't let your guard down."
December,29,2016,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all upper elevation, wind loaded slopes. Wind slabs are not the only concern. In places there is a weak, faceted layer of snow near an ice crust making avalanches possible. The danger is MODERATE at mid elevations. At elevations below 7000 feet, the avalanche danger is LOW.
I have a decent amount of uncertainty in the forecast today. Faceted layers are hard to predict and hard to ignore (see recent avalanche activity). For today, I would treat steep avalanche terrain as a no go, until you've gathered enough information about the slope. If this sounds complicated - then keep it simple, stick to low angle slopes under 30 degrees with nothing steep above or adjacent to you and you're good to go."
December,28,2016,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation, wind loaded slopes. Wind slabs are not the only concern. In places there is a weak, faceted layer of snow near an ice crust making avalanches possible and the danger MODERATE at mid elevations. At elevations below 7000 feet, the avalanche danger is LOW."
December,27,2016,"As the winds increase today, the avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on steep, upper elevation slopes with new drifts of wind blown snow.  In upper elevation, wind drifted terrain there also continues to be an isolated chance of triggering a deeper slide, breaking to the ground.
Out of the wind-affected terrain, the avalanche danger will remain LOW to MODERATE.   Smaller wind drifts, dry sluffs and wet loose sluffs could be triggered on steep slopes."
December,26,2016,"There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger today on steep upper elevation wind drifted slopes.  The avalanche danger is MODERATE out of the wind effected terrain and on mid elevation slopes for triggering a new snow sluff, soft slab or smaller wind drift. There continues to be an isolated chance of triggering a deeper slide, breaking mid pack or to the ground.
There is amazing turning and riding in untracked powder on slopes that are less steep than about 35 degrees and not connected to or below steep terrain, so give the snow on steep slopes another day to stabilize."
December,25,2016,Let's keep it simple.  The danger will spike to HIGH with the additional snow and wind today.  The danger will be most pronounced at the mid and upper elevations on many aspects.   Natural and human triggered avalanches are expected.  Those without excellent avalanche and route-finding skill should avoid being in or beneath steep terrain.  You can enjoy the Greatest Snow on Earth in our world class mountain resorts.
December,24,2016,"The avalanche danger is rising to CONSIDERABLE today. Falling snow and strong winds will create dangerous avalanche conditions as a winter storm moves through the area. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding, and conservative decision making are essential today in the backcountry. 
Pay careful attention to rapidly changing avalanche conditions due to wind loading and heavy snowfall."
December,23,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today at upper elevations. Heightened avalanche conditions exist where triggering a wind slab or a deeper persistent slab avalanche remains possible. The danger is generally LOW at the low and mid elevations but there may be isolated areas where triggered wind slabs are possible.  
Low danger does not mean NO danger. Practice safe travel protocols and re-evaluate your route if you encounter signs of instability. 
Pay careful attention to rapidly changing avalanche conditions due to wind loading, especially during the afternoon hours."
December,22,2016,The avalanche danger is MODERATE today at upper and mid elevations where triggering a wind slab or a deeper persistent slab avalanche remains possible. The danger is LOW at the low elevations.
December,21,2016,"The avalanche danger Is CONSIDERABLE today for triggering a hard wind slab on an upper elevation slopes facing northwest through southeast. These hard wind slabs can be triggered along the ridgelines or in open bowls, and the danger is MODERATE at the mid elevations where the wind has also drifted the snow. There is also a CONSIDERABLE danger of triggering a deep slide of all the storm snow on an upper elevation slope."
December,20,2016,"The avalanche danger Is CONSIDERABLE today for triggering a hard wind slab on an upper elevation slopes facing northwest through southeast.  These hard wind slabs can be triggered along the ridgelines or in open bowls, and the danger is MODERATE at the mid elevations where the wind has also drifted the snow.  There is also a CONSIDERABLE danger of triggering a deep slide of all the storm snow on an upper elevation slope."
December,19,2016,"A MODERATE danger exists for longer running dry...and potentially wet loose snow avalanches...in steep terrain today.  These sluffs may, in turn, pop out some lingering storm snow instabilities from our Thursday/Friday storm, resulting in a larger avalanche debris pile.  With plenty of snow to blow around, a developing MODERATE danger exists for sensitive new wind slabs in steep loaded terrain.  Shallow pockets of wind slab or lingering storm snow avalanches are possible in extreme terrain OR if the winds pick up beyond expectations."
December,18,2016,"There is an overall MODERATE Avalanche Danger on all steep mid and upper elevation slopes, where human triggered avalanches are possible. Wind slabs have potential to step down into deeper weaker layers, creating a much larger and dangerous avalanche. Avoid all steep, shallow, rocky wind drifted terrain."
December,17,2016,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE today in the Ogden mountains. Yesterday's strong winds and high precipitation rates created dangerous avalanche conditions. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route finding, and conservative decision making are essential as you travel in the backcountry today. 
Avoid slopes steeper than 30 degrees as well as locally connected terrain as the snowpack still needs time to adjust to the added weight of the new snow. In addition to wind and storm snow slabs, avalanches could break deeper in the snowpack on buried layers of weak facets. 
Avoid avalanche runout zones and other terrain traps, like gullies, where you could be caught by an avalanche coming from above you. 
If you want to ride the steep slopes, head to one of our world class resorts today."
December,16,2016,"The avalanche danger is HIGH today in the Ogden mountains. The strong winds and high precipitation rates have created very dangerous avalanche conditions and travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended. 
Avoid slopes steeper than 30 degrees as well as locally connected terrain. Avalanche danger will remain elevated throughout the day as a strong storm affects the area. 
With warm temperatures and rain at lower elevations, loose wet snow avalanches are possible in steep terrain. Pay attention to what's above and around you. 
If you are looking to ride the steeps, today is a great day to head to one of your local resorts."
December,15,2016,"Today, conditions are complex and tricky. There are many possible avalanche problems and the easiest solution is to simply avoid avalanche terrain by riding slopes less than 30 degrees in steepness and not connected to any steeper slopes. We're in a holding pattern as a major storm approaches the area. The avalanche danger should start rising late this afternoon and tonight when rain and snow will be falling.
With very strong winds, the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at upper elevation and wind loaded mid elevation slopes. With storm snow, wet snow, and persistent slab avalanche problems, the danger is MODERATE on non-wind loaded mid elevation slopes and all low elevation slopes."
December,14,2016,"This morning the danger is MODERATE at mid and upper elevations and LOW at low elevations with wind slabs being the primary problem. A few inches of new snow and increased winds are expected today which will make this problem more prevalent. Additionally, avalanches can break deeper in the snowpack on buried layers of weak facets. These two avalanche problems combined with changing weather will make conditions tricky today."
December,13,2016,"Avalanche conditions are still very complicated in the Ogden Mountains.  There is a possibility of human triggered avalanches today; mainly in upper-elevation wind drifted terrain.  These avalanches, with the help of our persistent weak layer could break to the ground.  The chances of that are slim, but if you were to find the sweet spot large un-survivable avalanches could be triggered.  More than likely these wind slabs will fail on NSF (Near Surface Facets) that formed prior to last weekends storm.  Skiing the South side of the compass is usually a safe bet but with current conditions these slopes are just as dangerous as the North.  
With more snow coming this weekend get familiar with the snow surface in the Ogden Mtns.  There is still great riding conditions on low angle sheltered terrain, why push it when more cold snow is on the way this weekend.  If you need to push the limits and ski the steep and deep head to one of our world class resorts!
Forecast written by Kory Davis and approved by Drew Hardesty"
December,12,2016,"It's a complicated avalanche picture out there as not only the new storm takes its time to adjust but the pre-existing snow structure takes time to adjust.   Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger still exists on steep mid and upper elevation wind drifted terrain.  This will be most pronounced on mid and upper elevation easterly facing slopes, but certainly not limited to this terrain.  Uncertainty, however, is high.  
A word to the wise: with great complexity and great uncertainty, great caution is required.  Remember that terrain is your friend:  excellent riding conditions can be found on sheltered slopes that are well less than 35 degrees in steepness."
December,11,2016,"The Avalanche Danger is HIGH today on all steep upper elevation slopes and CONSIDERABLE on all steep mid elevation slopes.   Natural avalanches are possible during periods of strong wind and human triggered slides certain.  
Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.  Those with excellent avalanche and terrain evaluation skills who do head out should stay on lower angle terrain - slopes of about 30 degrees or less, without steep slopes above you.  Long running natural avalanches occurred as recently as 4 am this morning."
December,10,2016,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE this morning and dangerous avalanche conditions exist on steep mid and upper elevation slopes, especially on northwest through east facing slopes. Human triggered avalanches are likely so careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding and conservative decision making are essential in the backcountry today. 
Avalanche danger will increase as continued snowfall and strong winds will combine to create widespread areas of unstable snow at mid and upper elevations today. Stay off of and out from under slopes steeper than 30 degrees. 
To stay safe today, your best bet is to find low angle, sheltered terrain."
December,09,2016,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE this morning on all steep mid and upper elevation slopes. Dangerous avalanche conditions exist. Human triggered avalanches are likely so careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding and conservative decision making are essential in the backcountry today. 
The avalanche danger is expected to rise throughout the day and remain elevated throughout the weekend. Heavy snow and strong winds will combine to create widespread areas of unstable snow at mid and upper elevations today. Stay off of and out from under slopes steeper than 30 degrees.
Be mindful of snow sliding off of roofs as these slides create deep piles of snow very quickly. Have the kids play away from structures and keep your head up if you're shoveling."
December,08,2016,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning but may rise toward MODERATE this afternoon with the onset of snow and wind.  Remember, Low danger doesn't mean No danger and shallow wind drifts and sluffs are possible in isolated terrain. 
I anticipate the danger to rise exponentially over the next several days."
December,07,2016,The avalanche danger is MODERATE at upper elevations where you are more likely to find wind slabs and wind drifted snow. At low and mid elevations the avalanche danger is LOW.
December,06,2016,The avalanche danger is LOW today at mid and low elevations and MODERATE at upper elevations where you are more likely to find wind slabs and wind drifted snow.
December,05,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE for all wind drifted slopes today. These wind slabs may be more pronounced on mid and upper elevation easterly (northeast to southeast) facing aspects, but terrain channelling allows for other aspects to be drifted as well. Approach any steep pillowy rounded slope with caution. These are changing conditions and the best and safest terrain will be in mid-elevation wind sheltered terrain with moderate slope angles."
December,04,2016,"The Avalanche Danger today is MODERATE on any steep slope with recent drifts of wind blown snow. These drifts will be most widespread at the upper elevations and found on a variety of aspects.  There is also on MODERATE danger on upper elevation northerly facing slopes where there is an isolated chance of triggering a deeper slide breaking on the facets near the ground.  You will find a LOW Avalanche Danger on low and mid elevations slopes out of the wind.  
You do not want to take a ride even in a small avalanche, as you could easily be injured with the shallow snow barely covering the rocks and dead-fall."
December,03,2016,"Heightened avalanche conditions exist at upper elevations in the backcountry this weekend, and you should evaluate the snow and terrain carefully.With a lingering deep, persistent slab avalanche problem in specific locations, the avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation northerly facing slopes. There is also on MODERATE danger at the upper elevations on any steep slope where new drifts of wind blown snow have formed. Avalanche conditions are generally safe at lower and mid elevations where the danger is LOW.
Westerly winds are a factor today in the Ogden area mountains. Keep on eye out for wind drifting as there is lots of snow available for transport and wind slabs will develop quickly. 
You do not want to take a ride even in a small avalanche, as you could easily be injured with the shallow snow hardly covering up the rocks and dead-fall in avalanche runout zones."
December,02,2016,"With a lingering deep, persistent slab avalanche problem in specific locations,  the avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation NW, N and NE slopes. Avalanche conditions are generally safe at lower and mid elevations where the danger is LOW.
Keep on eye out for wind drifting as there is lots of snow available for transport if wind speeds increase."
December,01,2016,"With a lingering deep, persistent slab avalanche problem in specific locations and the possibility of smaller avalanches breaking in the storm snow, the avalanche danger is MODERATE on all slopes at the mid and upper elevations. Avalanche conditions are generally safe at lower elevations where the danger is LOW."
November,30,2016,"For today the avalanche danger is MODERATE. Instabilities in the storm snow are gaining strength and the odds of triggering this type of slide are decreasing. Unfotunatley the odds of triggering a deep, persistent slab avalanche will not improve for some time."
November,29,2016,"One must approach steep terrain with the mindset of a CONSIDERABLE danger today.  Give the snow some time to adjust as conditions are likely to improve over the next day or so.  Longer running sluffs are expected in the cold smoke.  You'll find plenty of good and safe riding in the mid-elevation, sheltered terrain even on lower slope angles in the low density snow.  If heading into steeper terrain - it's game on:  One-at-a-time, have your rescue gear dialed, have good communication, make a plan.  It wouldn't surprise me to see a few close calls today."
November,28,2016,I expect the danger to rise to CONSIDERABLE AND MAY REACH HIGH today with the expected heavy snowfall and strong northwest winds.  Both natural and human triggered avalanches are expected.  Avalanche terrain is to be avoided...even terrain with steeper slopes above.  Traumatic injury is likely with any involvement in our still fledgling snowpack.  Many avalanche incidents occur during times of changing conditions.
November,27,2016,"An overall MODERATE avalanche danger is found on northerly upper elevation slopes, where you'll likely find fresh drifts of wind blown snow. These wind drifts have the potential to step down and break wider than expected. The consequences of getting caught in any avalanche on our thin, early-season snowpack means taking a ride over rocks and dead fall. The danger is LOW at all low elevation slopes."
November,26,2016,"Most terrain still has a LOW danger in the Ogden area mountains. Avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep slopes with fresh drifts of wind blown snow. These wind slabs will be most widespread along upper elevation ridgelines, though look for smaller drifts on mid elevation slopes, in open bowls and along gully walls. 
The consequences of getting caught in any avalanche on our thin, early-season snowpack means taking a ride over rocks and deadfall."
November,25,2016,"Most terrain still has a LOW danger in the Ogden area mountains.  A MODERATE danger exists in steep wind-drifted terrain primarily in the upper elevations along the highest ridge lines, though look for and avoid any smaller drifts that develop in open bowls at the mid elevations.   Getting caught even in a small slide can result in injury from hitting rocks due to the very thin coverage."
November,24,2016,"Most terrain still has a Low danger.  A Moderate danger exists in steep wind-drifted terrain primarily in the upper elevations.  Remember that we often have early season accidents and involvements as powder-fever tends to over-rule rational, conservative decision-making.  Remember that the traumatic injury is likely with any incident due to the still-thin coverage."
November,22,2016,"With 6-9 inches of new snow falling on dirt or only a few inches of old snow, avalanche conditions are generally safe and the avalanche danger is LOW.
Drew will issue the next advisory Thursday morning, and we will continue issuing intermittent updates depending on the weather."
November,21,2016,"The avalanche danger is Low and for most of us, there really isn't really enough snow on which to recreate.  
I will update the advisory tomorrow morning, and we will continue to issuing intermittent updates depending on the weather."
November,19,2016,"The avalanche danger is Low and for most of us, there really isn't really enough snow on which to recreate.  
We will be issuing intermittent updates more frequently if the forecasted storms materialize."
November,17,2016,There isn't really enough snow on which to recreate.  We'll issue updates as conditions warrant.
March,28,2015,The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE with daytime heating.  Human triggered wet loose snow avalanches are possible.  Some natural avalanche activity is also possible.  Get off of sunny slopes as they start to get too wet.  Keep in mind what is above you as the day progresses as to not be somewhere a wet avalanche could come down from above.
March,27,2015,"With only a minor refreeze last night and skyrocketing temps today, the danger will trend toward CONSIDERABLE for human triggered wet avalanches as the recent storm snow transitions from cold and dry to warm and wet.  While wet loose avalanches tend to run at a slower pace than their dry counterparts, it's more difficult to get untangled from flowing wet avalanches before they set up like concrete in the deposition zone.  Isolated pockets of lingering wind drifts may be found in the high alpine, more pronounced on north to easterly facing terrain."
March,26,2015,"During the heat of the day, the danger will rise toward CONSIDERABLE for human triggered wet loose sluffs as the recent storm snow transitions from cold and dry to warm and wet.  While wet loose avalanches tend to run at a slower pace than their dry counterparts, it's more difficult to get untangled from flowing wet avalanches before they set up like concrete in the deposition zone.  Isolated pockets of lingering wind drifts may be found in the high alpine, more pronounced on north to easterly facing terrain."
March,25,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE for triggering wind slabs and cornices on steep, mid and upper elevation, wind drifted slopes, with Pockets of CONSIDERABLE danger in the highest elevation wind zones.  The danger of wet, loose sluffs will increase to MODERATE as the day becomes warm and sunny and the winds decrease."
March,24,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE for triggering wind slabs and cornices on steep, upper elevation, wind drifted slopes. This danger will increase this afternoon through early evening as both winds and snow intensify around frontal passage.  If the clouds are slow to arrive this morning, there could be a brief period when wet snow sluffs could be triggered.  I will update this forecast by 7:30 am tomorrow morning, Wednesday, March 25."
March,23,2015,"The avalanche danger is rising to MODERATE for fresh wind drifts up to 8-12"" deep and more pronounced in the upper elevation exposed terrain.  Human triggered avalanches are now a concern with the new snow and wind.  Any sustained heating/sun will make the new snow unstable and prone to wet sluffing in the steep sun exposed terrrain."
March,21,2015,"The avalanche danger will increase to MODERATE with daytime heating.  Avoid travel on and below steep slopes once the snow becomes damp, wet or punchy.  The wet avalanche danger will gradually decrease with cooler temperatures into mid week."
March,19,2015,"This avalanche forecast is for Thursday, March 19 and Friday March 20th.  The avalanche danger Thursday and Friday will rapidly increase to MODERATE with daytime heating, and it will become possible to trigger wet loose snow sluffs and even wet slabs on steep slopes of all aspects and elevations still holding snow. Avoid travel on and below steep slopes once the snow becomes damp, wet or punchy.  We will update this forecast by 7:30 am Saturday morning."
March,18,2015,Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist in the mid and upper elevation northwest to east facing terrain for wet loose and wet slab avalanches. Unsupportable wet snow is a red flag.  Remember it's more difficult to get untangled from flowing wet avalanches and they set up like concrete in the deposition zone.  Elsewhere the danger is MODERATE.
March,17,2015,Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist in the mid and upper elevation northwest to east facing terrain for wet loose and wet slab avalanches.  Human triggered wet slabs 1-3' deep remain possible.  Remember it's more difficult to get untangled from flowing wet avalanches and they set up like concrete in the deposition zone.  Elsewhere the danger is MODERATE.
March,16,2015,"The danger from wet avalanches is MODERATE on all aspects and elevations with pockets of CONSIDERABLE on the normally shady aspects (NW, N, NE and E) because the snow is getting wet for the first time."
March,15,2015,"THE AVALANCHE DANGER IS INCREASING WITH THE CONTINUED WARMING TREND.  It is unclear how dangerous conditions will get today so you must travel as you would with any heightened avalanche danger.  Do not linger under steep slopes, stay out of gullies, and plan your route so you don't end up on or below steep slopes that have become too wet later in the day.  The danger is MODERATE and may reach CONSIDERABLE with daytime heating.  Natural avalanches are possible."
March,14,2015,We have a LOW avalanche danger this morning that will increase to MODERATE with daytime heating.  Don't linger below steep sunny slopes and stay out of gullies.  Watch the northerly terrain if it becomes wet.
March,13,2015,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW this morning, but will increase to MODERATE with daytime heating on the steep, sunny slopes and at the low to mid elevations, as the snow gets wet and soggy.  It will become possible to trigger wet loose snow sluffs on steep slopes.  There are also isolated places where a person could still trigger a dry slab avalanche, mostly on upper elevation slopes facing northerly through easterly."
March,12,2015,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW today, with pockets of MODERATE danger where a person could still trigger a dry slab avalanche, mostly on mid to upper elevation slopes facing northerly through easterly.  Wet avalanche activity should also be minor today, but avoid steep slopes anywhere the snowpack is soggy or the surface becomes wet with daytime heating or where it is raining on the snow."
March,11,2015,"Mostly LOW danger today with MODERATE danger for wet avalanche activity NOT LIMITED TO THE SOUTHERLY ASPECTS. Watch for warning signs such as rollerballs and small sluffs. While unlikely, it may be possible to trigger a slab in thin and steep mid-to upper elevation north to east facing terrain."
March,10,2015,"It's mostly LOW danger today with pockets of MODERATE for lingering persistent slabs on primarily steep, thin, rocky terrain on northwest through east facing slopes.  If you've over-stayed your welcome in the steep sun-exposed terrain, you'll find yourself in the thick of a MODERATE danger for wet sluffs in the heat of the day."
March,09,2015,"It's mostly LOW danger today with cautions for continued pockets of MODERATE danger for lingering persistent slabs in upper elevation, north through east facing slopes, especially in thin, rocky areas and also for wet sluffs in the heat of the day on steep, sun exposed slopes."
March,08,2015,There is an overall MODERATE avalanche danger today.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  Most likely places are steep north facing terrain above 9000 feet with shallow depths where the underlying snow remains weak.  Watch for wet activity with daytime heating.
March,07,2015,There is an overall MODERATE avalanche danger today.  Human triggered avalanches are possible that may break into faceted snow on the more northerly terrain.  The danger of wet avalanche activity will increase as daytime temperatures heat up.  You can definitely find trouble today if you're not paying close attention and continue to evaluate snow conditions as you travel through different terrain.
March,06,2015,"We're trending toward a SCARY MODERATE danger on the upper elevation north through east facing terrain.    The odds of triggering a 1-3' deep slide is slowly diminishing.  The consequence remain the same.   The danger for wet avalanches will be MODERATE on all the steep sun-exposed slopes with daytime warming.  
We have a danger gradient running north-south across the state with the danger even more pronounced in the Provo mountains and the Wasatch Plateau (where we have a Special Avalanche Bulletin)...all the way down to La Sals."
March,05,2015,"Pockets of CONSIDERABLE DANGER exist in steep northwest to northeast to southeast facing terrain above 9000' for triggering avalanches 1-3' deep and up to 200' wide.  These avalanches are exceedingly dangerous and notoriously unpredictable, often releasing at a distance, above you, or on the 3rd person down the slope.  The danger for wet avalanches may rise toward CONSIDERABLE on all the steep sun-exposed slopes with daytime warming.  
SAFE and 5 star powder can be found on the shady aspects on slopes LESS STEEP THAN 30 DEGREES with nothing steeper above or adjacent to you.  If you don't feel comfortable with the stability in the backcountry, consider heading to any one of our world class mountain resorts."
March,04,2015,"Avalanche danger is MODERATE on all aspects at the mid and upper elevations in the Ogden area mountains.  Human triggered avalanches are possible in steep terrain.  There are three different avalanche problems:

new snow soft slabs and sluffs can be triggered, especially where wind drifted
damp sluffs may occur on the steep, sunny slopes
in very isolated spots, slides could break on a buried layer of faceted weak snow

Travel Advice: Start out slow and reevaluate often.  Choose tours with low angle terrain options – less steep than about 35 degrees - and reassess often, especially if you head into steeper terrain.  Our below average, shallow snowpack has lots of variability."
March,03,2015,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on all slopes approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  Human triggered avalanche are likely.  Natural avalanches are possible, especially during periods of intense snowfall and wind.  New snow soft slabs and sluffs will be widespread, and a few slides on the more northerly facing slopes may step down into a deeper weak layer, resulting in a large dangerous slide.  Avoid travel on and below steep slopes today."
March,02,2015,"The danger today depends how fast the storm piles up weight on the pre-existing soft snow.  The danger should start at LOW this morning and rise to MODERATE by afternoon as the snow accumulates.  As you travel, be sure to test how well the new snow bonds to the underlying snow by jumping on small test slopes and digging down with your hand.  The danger may rise to CONSIDERABLE by Tuesday depending on what the storm does."
March,01,2015,"The majority of the terrain has a LOW avalanche danger today.  There is a ""pockety"" MODERATE avalanche danger on steep upper elevation terrain where yesterday's winds created fresh drifts.  These drifts are on a variety of aspects and crossloaded terrain features.  Keep in mind the wind was from the southeast which loaded west facing slopes, something that we don't always see that often."
February,28,2015,We have an overall LOW danger in the Wasatch Range.  Minor concerns include dry loose snow avalanches that may move with provocation on the steeper slopes that received the most snow.  Watch for fresh drifting if the winds increase more than anticipated.
February,27,2015,We have an overall LOW danger in the Wasatch Range.  Minor concerns include dry loose snow avalanches that may move with provocation on the steeper slopes that received the most snow....and any lingering wind pocket from the week's easterly then westerly winds.
February,26,2015,"We have an overall LOW avalanche danger in the backcountry.  Very isolated pockets of lingering wind slab may crack out in the highest alpine terrain.  Similarly, if we see more snow than expected, loose snow avalanches may run with provocation in the steeper upper elevation terrain."
February,25,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today for triggering a new wind drift at the upper elevations, especially on slopes with an easterly component.  There are pockets of MODERATE danger for these same wind drifts at the mid elevations.  Stay off any steep slope with a new drift of wind blown snow - getting caught would feel like have a rug yanked out from under you.  The consequences are increased if you could be carried over a cliff or into trees."
February,24,2015,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW today, with two caveats:  First, you could trigger one of the scattered small hard wind drifts, just large enough to take a person for a ride – serious in steep, rocky or treed terrain.  Secondly, as the day and snow heats up, avoid the steep sunny slopes facing east through south through west, where it will be possible to trigger a wet sluff."
February,23,2015,Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger today but there is a MODERATE avalanche danger for recent deposits of wind drifted snow on steep slopes and also a MODERATE danger of wet sluffs and slabs on steep slopes facing into the sun in the heat of the day.
February,22,2015,Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger today.  A 'pockety' MODERATE danger exists in the higher very steep terrain where someone may trigger a recent drift.
February,21,2015,There is generally a LOW avalanche danger today.  Watch for minor fresh wind drifts in the highest terrain.
February,20,2015,The avalanche danger is LOW.
February,19,2015,The avalanche danger is LOW.
February,18,2015,We have a LOW avalanche danger.
February,17,2015,There is an overall LOW avalanche danger today.
February,16,2015,There is an overall LOW avalanche danger today.
February,15,2015,The danger is mostly LOW.  Generally safe avalanche conditions.  Minor wet activity and cornice fall are the concerns for today.  Remember that Risk is always inherent in any mountain travel.
February,14,2015,"The danger is mostly LOW this morning before pushing into the MODERATE category for wet avalanches during the heat of the day.  Avoid being in the steep sun-exposed terrain when the snow starts to become wet, sloppy, and unsupportable."
February,13,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, and avalanches are unlikely. As the day and snow heats up, the danger of wet loose sluffs, large enough to catch and carry a person, will increase, especially on steep, sunny slopes.  And if you are traveling in upper elevation terrain, small wind drifts, dry loose sluffs and cornices can also be triggered."
February,12,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, and avalanches are unlikely.  As the day and snow heats up, the danger will increase to MODERATE on steep, sunny slopes, where it will become possible to trigger small, damp loose sluffs.  If you are heading to the Logan area mountains or the Western Uintas, check out their area specific forecasts, as the danger is higher in these regions."
February,11,2015,There is generally a LOW avalanche danger today.  Anticipate minor wet activity on sunny slopes as the newest snow heats up.  Avoid being in confined gullies and on or below steep sunny slopes as the snow gets wet.
February,10,2015,Most areas have a LOW avalanche danger today.  There is a pockety MODERATE danger for triggering fresh wind drifts along the steep upper elevation ridges most pronounced on easterly facing slopes.  Anticipate minor wet activity on upper elevation southerly slopes that received more than a trace of snow.
February,09,2015,"The danger today is mostly LOW.  But IF we get more than the 1-2 inches of new snow forecast or the wind does not drop with the arrival of the cold front, expect a MODERATE danger of wind slabs and storm snow instabilities."
February,08,2015,The danger for wet avalanches will rise to MODERATE on all aspects and elevations but for the high northerlies.  Human triggered wet sluffs and wet slabs will be likely in the dampened and wet snow with sun and daytime heating.  Springtime exits (start early-finish early) are key to avoid being in or below unsupportable wet snow in steep terrain.  Pockets of lingering wind drifts may also be found in the high alpine terrain generally facing north through east.  Cornices will again be sensitive today.
February,07,2015,"A MODERATE danger exists for wind slabs and wet avalanches.  A great deal of uncertainty exists for today's advisory...and when I feel a great deal of uncertainty I tend to take a step back from the edge.  Until the wind stops and temps cool off, it's best to take a conservative approach for steep mountain travel even in the mid and lower elevations."
February,06,2015,"The avalanche danger will rapidly rise to MODERATE with day time heating, on steep slopes of almost all aspects and elevations.  As the snow becomes damp or slushy, wet loose sluffs can be triggered and often run further than expected. Isolated cornices, wind drifts and loose sluffs can be triggered in upper elevation terrain, along the higher ridgelines and in open bowls."
February,05,2015,"The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE with day time heating, and it will become easy to trigger long running wet loose sluffs, especially on steep, sunny slopes.  Once the snow becomes damp or soggy, avoid steep terrain.  Isolated cornices and wind drifts can be triggered along the higher ridgelines."
February,04,2015,A MODERATE danger exists in the high easterly terrain for new and developing wind drifts up to a foot or so deep.  The danger may be more pronounced in the Monte Cristo area east of the Huntsville valley as they've picked up more precipitation.  A MODERATE danger for wet avalanches also exists at the lower elevations below 8000' in the northerly aspects.  The danger of wet avalanches may rise toward CONSIDERABLE on all steep southerly to westerly aspects if we see some clearing today.
February,03,2015,"Most terrain still has a LOW avalanche danger today but there is a MODERATE danger for fresh wind drifts along the upper elevation ridges.  Watch for ""pockety"" wind slabs along the upper elevation ridges especially on the easterly facing terrain and consider consequences if you're in radical terrain.  Continue to prod and jump on any fresh drifts in safe terrain to get a feel of how sensitive they are."
February,02,2015,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger today.  Watch for ""pockety"" wind slabs along the mid and upper elevation ridges especially on the easterly facing terrain and consider consequences if you're in radical terrain.  Continue to prod and jump on any fresh drifts in safe terrain to get a feel of how sensitive they are."
February,01,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep, wind drifted upper elevation slopes.  While the drifts can be found on all aspects, they will be most widespread on northeast, east and southeasterly facing slopes.. Even a small slide can have serious consequences in radical terrain, if it takes you for a long ride or through rocks, trees and cliffs.  If the snow starts toi heating where you are, and damp sluffs become possible, move to lower angle terrain or to a cooler aspect.."
January,31,2015,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW in the Ogden area mountains.  Still, be alert for and avoid any new wind drifts that form as the wind speeds pick up today, especially along the upper elevation ridge lines.  Even a small slide can have serious consequences in radical terrain, if it takes you for a long ride or through rocks, trees and cliffs."
January,30,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW, though small avalanches could be triggered in isolated terrain.    The upper elevation northwesterly through northeasterly facing terrain has pockets of MODERATE danger as these slopes are the most likely place to trigger a new wind drift or small sluff.  Even a small slide can have serious consequences in radical terrain, if it takes you for a long ride or through rocks, trees and cliffs."
January,29,2015,"We have a MODERATE danger in the Ogden and Logan area mountains for soft slab avalanches within the new snow and if we get sunshine today, for wet, loose avalanches within the new snow."
January,28,2015,A MODERATE danger for new snow avalanches exists in the upper elevations for loose snow sluffs and wind drifts up to a foot or so.  Elsewhere the danger is LOW.  Any new sluffing or shallow wind drifting should remain minor and manageable for old hands and other experienced backcountry travellers.
January,27,2015,"We're transitioning back toward a LOW avalanche danger but I want another 24 hours in the cooling trend before we give it an all-out green (L1).  For today, consider it MODERATE for human triggered wet loose push-a-lanches until proven otherwise.  Even northerlies may be suspect.  The wet loose danger should be immediately recognizable based on how the snow reacts under your feet or sled.  Avoid being in terrain above terrain traps."
January,26,2015,The avalanche danger may rise to CONSIDERABLE during daytime heating.  I am quite unsure just how the snowpack will react to the anticipated very warm temperatures so forecast confidence is low.  Avoid being on or below steep sunny slopes as they heat up starting with east facing first and working south then west as the sun moves during the day.
January,25,2015,The avalanche danger is LOW but remember that your overall risk is amplified by your terrain choices.  Minor shallow wind pockets and shallow loose snow avalanches can be significant for those in severe and unforgiving terrain.  Awareness is key to these minor avalanche concerns and the danger is obviously higher if you are unaware of these situations.
January,24,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW but remember that your overall risk is amplified by your terrain choices.  Minor shallow wind pockets, cornice fall, and shallow loose snow avalanches can be significant for those in severe and unforgiving terrain."
January,23,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW but remember that your overall risk is amplified by your terrain choices.  Minor shallow wind pockets, cornice fall, and shallow loose snow avalanches can be significant for those in severe and unforgiving terrain."
January,22,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW, and there are only isolated places where an avalanche could be triggered. Watch for isolated new wind drifts along the high ridgelines, loose dry sluffs on steep northerly facing slopes and the possibility of a few damp sluffs on steep southerly facing slopes.  Even a small slide can have serious consequences in radical terrain, if it takes you for a long ride or through rocks, trees and cliffs."
January,21,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW.  While generally safe avalanche conditions exist, unstable snow could occur on isolated terrain features.  If you are in steep or radical terrain, have a defensive attitude – even a small slide can have serious consequences if it takes you off a cliff, for a long ride through rocks or into trees."
January,20,2015,"The overall avalanche danger is LOW in most terrain.  There is still a ""pockety"" MODERATE avalanche danger for recent deposits of wind drifted snow mainly along the lee sides of the mid and upper elevation ridges.  Consider consequences of even a small avalanche."
January,19,2015,"The overall avalanche danger is LOW in most terrain.  The avalanche danger is at the low end of MODERATE for triggering a drift in the very steep upper elevation terrain.  Again, consider consequences of even a small avalanche."
January,18,2015,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW but there are pockets of MODERATE danger for wind slabs on any steep slope with recent wind deposits (which usually look smooth and rounded) and also pockets of lingering, persistent slabs in wind and sun-sheltered terrain."
January,17,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today for triggering a wind drift, or wind slab on all mid and upper elevations slopes. The hard, cracky wind drifts will be most widespread on the north through southeasterly facing slopes, in the upper elevation terrain.  But you will be able to find and trigger these wind drifts in the mid elevation terrain, too.  Avoid all steep slopes with drifts of wind blown snow and stay well back from the corniced ridge lines.
A search for wind sheltered, shady terrain may reward you with both safer terrain and dense, but soft powder."
January,16,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today as the increasing winds blow snow into sensitive drifts.  These cracky wind drifts will be most widespread on the north through easterly facing slopes, in the upper elevation terrain.  Avoid all steep slopes with drifts of wind blown snow.
Go to terrain: wind sheltered, northerly facing slopes will have that combo of soft powder and lower avalanche danger."
January,15,2015,"A MODERATE danger for wind drifts should be stabilizing by day's end.  You may find these pockets scattered across the compass and generally just off the ridgelines.  The danger for wet loose and wet slab avalanches will rise toward CONSIDERABLE with daytime heating and direct sun.  
Travel Tip - Be off of and out from underneath the steep sunlit slopes by midday.  The best and safest terrain will be in shady sheltered mid-elevation glades."
January,14,2015,There is generally a MODERATE avalanche danger today.  The danger of wet avalanches on southerly facing slopes may rise to CONSIDERABLE if the sun heats the newest snow enough.  Stay off of and out from under any steep sunny slope that is becoming damp.  Continue to be aware of wind slabs in the upper elevation terrain.
January,13,2015,Treat the avalanche danger as CONSIDERABLE until you can prove that it's MODERATE.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  Watch for any cracking within the new snow which indicates instability.  The danger could increase rapidly if the northeast winds start to drift snow mid day.  I suspect things will be manageable again today if you use your head.
January,12,2015,The avalanche danger will start out Low this morning and will probably creep into the Moderate category as the snow accumulates this afternoon and evening.  Be sure to jump on small test slopes and regularly dig down with your hand to test how well the new snow is bonding and adjust your terrain accordingly.
January,11,2015,"The avalanche danger is mostly Low.  Very shallow sluffs and wind slab are possible in the higher terrain.  Otherwise, human triggered avalanches are unlikely but not impossible.  Some risk is always inherent in mountain travel."
January,10,2015,The avalanche danger is mostly Low.  Human triggered avalanches are unlikely but not impossible.  Some risk is always inherent in mountain travel.
January,09,2015,"There are lingering pockets of MODERATE danger of wet avalanches on the sun exposed slopes today (that face generally the south half of the compass).  
There are still isolated places on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through east where a person could trigger a deeper, more dangerous slide failing on faceted snow or depth hoar, creating a pockety MODERATE danger."
January,08,2015,"The avalanche danger continues to be MODERATE for both natural and human triggered wet avalanches on all aspects and elevations, especially during the heat of the day.   Get off of and out from under steep slopes before the snow becomes wet and soggy.  Cornices are becoming sensitive, and could break off further back than expected.   
There are still isolated places on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through east where a person could trigger a deeper, more dangerous slide failing on facets, a pockety MODERATE danger."
January,07,2015,"With sun and daytime heating, the avalanche danger will rapidly rise to MODERATE for both natural and human triggered wet avalanches.    Avoid travel on and below steep slopes as the snow becomes wet and soggy, especially the steep sunny aspects. Even a small wet slide can take you for a long, dangerous ride.  Roof-a-lanches will continue - the dense, icy snow can slide off roofs, and could bury a person in a deep pile of snow."
January,06,2015,The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE during the mid day and into the afternoon as temperatures increase.  Plan your routes accordingly so you don't end up in terrain traps or below steep slopes when the avalanche danger increases.  Don't linger under the eves of roofs that are holding a substantial amount of snow.
January,05,2015,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger today.  There is still a ""pockety"" MODERATE avalanche danger in the upper elevations where human triggered avalanches are still possible.  Continue to treat areas with wind drifted snow as suspect.  Especially watch for areas where these drifts are sitting on a shallow weak snowpack."
January,04,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on any steep slopes with drifts of wind-blown snow, which may be hard and cracky.  These drifts will be most widespread in upper elevation terrain, especially along the ridge lines.  The danger is also MODERATE for the isolated chance of triggering a deeper slide on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through east, that would break on a buried layer of weak faceted snow."
January,03,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on any steep slope with fresh drifts of wind-blown snow.  These sensitive drifts will be most common on upper elevation slopes facing northeast through southeast, but could occur in any upper elevation terrain.  The danger is also MODERATE for the isolated chance of triggering a deeper slide breaking on a buried weak layer of faceted snow.  This poor snow pack structure is most widespread on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through east."
January,02,2015,There is an overall moderate avalanche danger today outside of the wind it affected terrain.  Human triggered avalanches are possible today.  The danger is a greater in the higher terrain where the recent wind has deposited and drifted snow.  Avoid steep slopes with any thick snow or 'pillowy' looking drifts.
January,01,2015,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist in the backcountry. Human triggered avalanches 1-3' deep are possible.  The danger is most pronounced up high on steep westerly aspects due to recent wind drifting...as well as north to easterly facing slopes above 8000'.  Continue to put only one person on the slope at a time.  Make a plan.  Follow it.  And get out of the way at the bottom.  
Remember - safe, excellent powder can be found in the shady sheltered terrain on slopes of 30 degrees in steepness or less as long as nothing steeper is above."
December,31,2015,"The Avalanche Danger is MODERATE on mid and upper elevation slopes facing west through north through east that are steeper than about 35 degrees, where in isolated places a person could still trigger a large avalanche breaking to the ground.  Lower angle slopes and those that have slid offer safer choices."
December,30,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on slopes over 35 degrees in steepness that face west, north and east in the mid and upper elevations.  There is a low chance that a rider could trigger a high consequence avalanche today.  Steep slopes that already avalanched are safer.  Areas with a shallower overall snowpack that haven't avalanched are suspect."
December,29,2015,"A MODERATE danger exists in the backcountry.  Moderate can be defined as ""small avalanches in specific areas; or large avalanches in isolated areas"".  The danger is most pronounced on north to east facing steep, thin, rocky terrain - and - as per their character - deep slabs may be triggered from a distance or below. We're in a Low-probability/High-consequence regime that has contributed to more than a couple accidents over the years.  
Note that the danger is more pronounced in the Western Uintas and the Wasatch Plateau.  Check the forecasts in these areas for more info."
December,28,2015,"Today the avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on slopes above 7000 feet generally on the northern half of compass including those facing east. Human triggered avalanches 3-5 feet deep are likely and the consequences will be deadly. The avalanche danger is lower on slopes at lower elevations on southerly aspects.
Remember - if you step outside the exit gates from a mountain resort, your are entering dangerous avalanche conditions."
December,27,2015,"Areas of Considerable remain in the backcountry and are most pronounced in upper elevation northerly to easterly aspects. Natural avalanches are unlikely, and human triggered avalanches remain possible with crowns 3-5' deep, running to the ground and rocks. If you do trigger a slide, consequences are catastrophic. Some wet sluffing may be expected on the steepest, sunny slopes with daytime heating.
You may still find recent wind drifts on mid and upper elevations slopes from the easterly winds. Although there has been crossloading onto other aspects as well. 
Remember - if you step outside the exit gates from a mountain resort, your are stepping into CONSIDERABLE danger. Terrain management and safe protocol is key today. Safe and stellar 5-star powder can be found on slopes less steep  than 30 degrees with nothing steeper above."
December,26,2015,"The danger is CONSIDERABLE.  Natural avalanches are possible, human triggered avalanches 2-5' deep are likely.  Today and tomorrow are classic avalanche accident conditions.  Remember that these avalanches may be triggered from adjacent terrain or below.  Shallow new snow wind drifts and longer running sluffs may be initiated in the steepest exposed terrain today. 
Remember if you step outside the exit gates from a mountain resort, you are stepping into CONSIDERABLE danger.  Terrain management is key today. Safer and still 5-star powder can be found on slopes less steep than 30 degrees with nothing steeper above."
December,25,2015,"The Avalanche Danger is HIGH in upper and mid elevation terrain facing northerly through easterly, where large avalanches breaking to the ground and running long distances could be triggered by a person.  Avalanches can still be triggered remotely from a distance and from below.  Most other slopes steeper than about 30 degrees have a CONSIDERABLE danger, with the lowest danger on southerly facing slopes at the lower elevations.
Provo – most of the Provo ice climbs are in avalanche paths – large natural avalanches can release from above and travel 1000’s of feet down over the climbs."
December,24,2015,"The Avalanche Warning has been continued for the all mountains of northern and central Utah.  The avalanche danger is HIGH in upper and mid elevation terrain, where large avalanches breaking to the ground and running long distances have occurred.   Human triggered slides are very likely today, and can be triggered remotely from a distance and from below."
December,23,2015,The avalanche danger is HIGH.  Conditions are ripe for an avalanche accident.  Travel in the backcountry is not recommended.
December,22,2015,Today the avalanche danger is HIGH. Travel in or even near avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. Avalanches may break within the new snow or near the ground. Do not go into the backcountry if you do not know how to identify and avoid avalanche terrain.
December,21,2015,The snowpack has been producing avalanches and giving warning signs since last Thursday. New snow since yesterday has created dangerous avalanche conditions and the avalanche danger is HIGH on upper elevation slopes with wind drifted snow. Other slopes are very close to their breaking point and have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger. Heavy snow will arrive this afternoon and the avalanche danger will be increasing.
December,20,2015,"The danger is MODERATE for human triggered avalanches in the backcountry today and more pronounced on steep mid and upper elevation northwest to east facing slopes.  If we get more snow than expected, watch for the usual shallow sluffs and wind drifts in steep terrain. The danger will be on the rise over the next several days.  
This week's storm has Avalanche Accident written all over it.  Probably more than one.  Combine heavy snow and wind, a rotten-to-the-core snowpack, Christmas vacation, and a hungry for powder Utah crowd.  Along the arc of risk and desire lies the unwritten accident.  Have a safe holiday season."
December,19,2015,"Most terrain has an overall MODERATE danger.  A CONSIDERABLE danger, however, persists in the upper elevation northwest to north to east facing terrain where human triggered slides up to 2-3' deep remain possible.  The danger may be more pronounced along the Park City ridgeline and in the mountains along the BCC/Mill Creek crest.  Collapsing and shooting cracks are immediate signs of instability.  New wind drifts along the high northerly terrain and wet sluffs and roof-slides round out today's concerns."
December,18,2015,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through easterly and steeper than about 30 degrees.   Human triggered slides are possible, and can be triggered remotely from a distance. Other steep slopes have a MODERATE danger of triggering new snow slides, wind drifts or wet sluffs.
Low angle terrain is the place to recreate in the backcountry -whether you are riding, turning, snowshoeing or sledding."
December,17,2015,"The avalanche danger is High on and below all upper elevation slopes steeper than about 30 degrees.  Natural avalanches have occurred, and human triggered slides are very likely today.  Both new wind drifts and slides breaking near the ground on weak facets could be triggered today.  Backcountry travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended."
December,16,2015,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE today.  Human triggered avalanches are likely on slopes 35 degrees and steeper that face west, north and east.  THE AVALANCHE DANGER WILL BE ON THE RISE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS WITH MORE SNOW AND WIND IN THE FORECAST."
December,15,2015,"Today there is a HIGH danger on at upper elevations. The last 48 hours of snowfall combined with increased winds overnight has created very dangerous avalanche conditions and travel in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. Conditions are tricky because we don't know exactly how close the snowpack is to its breaking point, and this uncertainty is good reason to be conservative."
December,14,2015,"There is a HIGH danger on northerly aspects at upper elevations. Today's snowfall has created very dangerous avalanche conditions and travel in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended. With snowfall continuing and winds expected to increase later today, the danger on other slopes could rise to HIGH as well."
December,13,2015,"The overall danger is MODERATE for new and developing wind drifts today.  These may be most pronounced on steep north to east to southerly slopes at the mid and upper elevations.  For those heading into the north westerly to east facing slopes, any newly triggered wind drift may step down into older, weaker snow 1-2' deep.  Cracking and collapsing should be a red light today.   
The danger will be on the rise over the next several days."
December,12,2015,The overall danger in the backcountry is LOW.  Remember that risk is always inherent in mountain travel.  Low danger may still provide for small avalanches but terrain choices amplify the consequences of a small slide.
December,11,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all wind-drifted slopes approaching 35 degrees or steeper.  There is also a moderate danger for slides breaking into weak, sugary snow – most widespread on slopes facing northwest through easterly.  Getting caught in a slide is especially dangerous with our shallow snowpack, due to the likelihood of a rough ride along the ground and rocks."
December,10,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW this morning, but it could rise to MODERATE later today if the snow starts to drift where you are.  Avoid any new wind drifts on slopes approaching 35 degrees or steeper.  Overnight, the addition of new snow will continue to increase the avalanche danger to at least MODERATE, with slides potentially breaking into deeper layers."
December,09,2015,Avalanche conditions are generally safe but you could trigger small wind slabs in isolated locations.
December,07,2015,The avalanche danger is LOW. Some small wind slabs could be triggered but the main hazard remains hitting rocks and stumps.
December,05,2015,"The overall danger is mostly LOW.  Isolated hard wind drifts may be found in the highest alpine terrain.  Remember that risk is always inherent in mountain travel. Currently, the main hazard is the thinly veiled collection of trees, stumps, and deadfall lying beneath and among 1-2' of snow on the ground.  
This advisory will be valid through Sunday evening.  We'll continue to issue advisories as conditions warrant."
December,04,2015,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW  in the Ogden area mountains, due to a lack of snow.  However, there is an isolated  MODERATE today for triggering a wind slab on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through east. The most likely place to trigger a slide would be a slope approaching 35 degrees or steeper, in the wind zone along a higher ridge line.   Drifts will be more isolated on other upper elevation aspects and in mid elevation terrain.  Drew will update this forecast Saturday morning."
December,01,2015,The majority of the mountain terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  There is a MODERATE danger for the aforementioned wind slabs along the higher terrain where the wind has stirred the newer snow up.  This scattered avalanche danger will continue to decrease during the week. The next updated advisory will be Friday.
November,30,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today at upper elevations due to increased WNW winds where fresh winds slabs are resting on weak, faceted snow. On other slopes without wind drifting, the avalanche danger is LOW and avalanche conditions are generally safe. The biggest hazard remains hitting rocks or logs."
November,29,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW today.  Avalanche conditions are generally safe – however you could trigger a small, old wind drift on a few isolated terrain features.  The most likely place would be a steep slope, approaching 35 degrees or steeper, along a ridge line.   With our very shallow snow pack, the chance of hitting rocks and logs is a serious issue."
November,28,2015,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW today; there is an isolated MODERATE danger along the high ridge lines for scattered wind drifts, which could be triggered in steep terrain.  The shallow snow pack makes getting caught in even a small slide dangerous, as you would get dragged along the ground, scrapping rocks."
November,27,2015,The overall avalanche danger is LOW today.  There might be isolated areas that have a MODERATE danger where a small wind slab might crack out.  The steep terrain along the upper ridgelines is where a person might trigger a small wind slab.
November,26,2015,The majority of the terrain has a LOW avalanche danger today.  There is a MODERATE avalanche danger along the ridgetops where spotty wind slabs might release under the weight of a person.  Watch for any cracking when you are in the upper elevations which would indicate there may be fresh sensitive drifts present.
November,25,2015,"Most terrain harbors a Low avalanche danger.  Localized areas of MODERATE danger exist, however, due to the strong southerly winds over the past 36 hours or so.  The main concern centers around the potential for triggering pockety wind drifts and then being raked through the rocks and deadfall of our vertically challenged snowpack.  The best and safest riding conditions remain on upper elevation wind and sun sheltered low angled terrain."
November,23,2015,"The avalanche danger is LOW today for triggering a slide.
We will update this forecast Tuesday or Wednesday depending on the timing of the approaching storm and increased winds ahead of the storm."
November,21,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today for triggering a slide that would fail near the ground.  The most likely slope would be an upper elevation slope facing northwest through east, which is wind-drifted slope or has a deeper, stiffer snowpack.
It is not the time of year to get caught in a slide – even a short ride in a small avalanche would be rough, as you get dragged along the ground, bouncing off rocks, stumps and deadfall.
We will update this forecast Monday or Tuesday, earlier if conditions change."
November,20,2015,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today for triggering a wind drift, which then has the potential to step down to the ground.  Avoid any steep slope with rounded, dense or hard wind drifts.  These dangerous drifts will be most widespread on upper elevation slopes, especially those facing northerly through easterly.
Any slide you trigger could eventually break to the ground, resulting in a nasty, rough ride, as you get dragged through rocks and trees."
November,18,2015,"The Ogden mountains harbor a generally LOW avalanche danger.  Very isolated and stubborn wind drifts may be triggered in the upper elevations.  Remember that consequences will be accentuated as the avalanche victim will get raked through rocks and deadfall in the still early season snowpack. 
This advisory will be updated again Saturday morning."
November,17,2015,Shallow areas of new wind drifts up high will lead to areas of Moderate danger.  They'll be pockety in nature and relegated to the upper elevations and may be sensitive to human weight.  Avoid the smooth and rounded drifts and remember that any slide will likely result in traumatic injury due to the thin snow cover.
November,16,2015,"In most places this morning's new snow fell on dirt. Wind should increase from the north this afternoon and form some wind slabs. The danger is generally LOW and there is not enough snow to for skiiing.
We will continue to issue intermittent advisories as conditions warrant."
November,15,2015,"The Avalanche Danger is generally LOW, but Pockets of Moderate Danger exist for fresh pockets of wind drifted snow.  These will be most widespread on upper to mid elevation slopes facing northwest through easterly, and sensitive because they are sitting on weak, sugary snow.   Cracking or audible collapsing are red flags that you are in suspect terrain. With such a thin and shallow snow pack, even a short ride could leave you banged up and injured.
We will continue to issue intermittent advisories as conditions warrant."
November,12,2015,"Despite the new snow, the primary danger is still hitting rocks and stumps. Look for fresh wind slabs formed by increased NW winds this morning. For today, look for unstable snow in isolated areas and the avalanche danger is rated LOW.
We will continue issuing intermittent advisories until more snow comes."
November,11,2015,"Despite the new snow, the primary danger is still hitting rocks and stumps. Look for fresh wind slabs formed by increased NW winds this morning. For today, look for unstable snow in isolated areas and the avalanche danger is rated LOW.
We will continue issuing intermittent advisories until more snow comes."
November,10,2015,"With such little snow, the primary danger is hitting rocks and stumps and the avalanche danger is LOW. Until more snow comes, we will be issuing intermittent advisories that will be updated with each storm."
November,09,2015,"With a storm on the way, we will issue an avalanche forecast tomorrow morning, Tuesday, by 7:30 am, for the Salt Lake and Park City mountains.
Depending on snow amounts, we may update Ogden area forecast too."
November,03,2015,"Winter is on the way, and we will issue intermittent avalanche forecasts as conditions warrant."
November,01,2015,"Winter is on the way, and we will issue intermittent avalanche forecasts this week as the upcoming storm dictates."
April,13,2014,The avalanche danger is LOW this morning but may reach MODERATE today with the new snow.  Watch for any fresh drifts and for point releases if the sun pokes out late today.
April,12,2014,"The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE today.  There is a low probability of getting caught in a wet avalanche but the consequences are high.  If you're considering a significant outing in the high country, it may be better to wait until temperatures cool down on Sunday."
April,11,2014,"Avalanche danger starts out Low in the morning but will rise to Considerable in the heat of the afternoon.  Get off of, and out from underneath, all steep slopes after the snow gets wet from sun and warm temperatures by noon or especially in the afternoon.  Also, avoid cornices and areas where glide avalanches occur regularly such as Stairs Gulch and Broads Fork."
April,10,2014,"Start early, and by mid day or when the snow heats up it will be time to change your jersey, and choose another sport for the afternoon.  Head to the ski areas to make more turns, go road or dirt biking, hiking, golfing, rock climbing - the avalanche danger in the backcountry will rise to CONSIDERABLE for WET AVALANCHES.   Human triggered slides are likely on steep slopes of most aspects and elevations as the snow heats up, and natural wet sluffs and wet slabs could occur on steep slopes, engulfing you from above.    Avoid travel on and beneath steep snow covered slopes, especially avoiding confined gullies and terrain traps such as creek beds."
April,09,2014,"With direct sun and skyrocketing temperatures, the danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on and beneath all of the steep sunlit slopes today.  Natural and human triggered wet loose and wet slab avalanches are likely during and just after the heat of the day.  Depending on cloud cover, I'd expect some significant activity today.  Heating will also affect many northerly slopes as well - avoid being in or above terrain traps in steep northerly low to mid-elevation terrain.  A pockety MODERATE danger exists for lingering wind and storm snow avalanches in the northeast to south facing terrain above about 9000'."
April,08,2014,"With direct sun and skyrocketing temperatures, the danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on and beneath all of the steep sunlit slopes today.  Natural and human triggered wet avalanches are likely during and just after the heat of the day.  Also avoid being in or above terrain traps in steep northerly low to mid-elevation terrain. A MODERATE danger exists for lingering storm snow avalanches in the northeast to south facing terrain above about 9000'; and pockety on other aspects..."
April,07,2014,"With sun and daytime heating, the avalanche danger will rapidly rise to MODERATE, and then to CONSIDERABLE for WET AVALANCHES.   Human triggered slides will be possible on steep slopes of almost all aspects and elevations, and natural wet sluffs could occur on the steep, sunny slopes especially south through west facing.   
Finishing your backcountry day early is key - get off of and out from under steep slopes as the snow starts to heat up, especially avoiding long, steep slopes, gullies and terrain traps such as creek beds.
In addition, it is possible to trigger wind drifts and dry sluffs in steep, upper elevation terrain."
April,06,2014,The avalanche danger will remain generally LOW today.  Watch for any wind drifted snow in the upper elevations that may be sensitive.  Be aware of temperatures getting too warm if the sun comes out.
April,05,2014,The avalanche danger is generally LOW this morning.  It may rise to MODERATE during the day if we see any periods of intense snowfall or solar heating.  Get out of confined terrain if you noticed either of these situations occurring.
April,04,2014,"The avalanche danger is mostly Low but you may find some Moderate: 1) on slopes with lingering wind slabs from yesterday's wind along the upper elevation ridges and 2) if we get significant sun warming today, the danger will rise to Moderate for wet sluffs on steep slopes that are getting wet from sun warming."
April,03,2014,"The avalanche danger will rapidly rise MODERATE and even CONSIDERABLE for WET AVALANCHES today – whenever the sun heats the snow.  Both human triggered and natural will be possible on steep slopes of almost all aspects and elevations.   Early starts and early finishes are key - get off of and out from under steep slopes as the snow heats up.
In addition, it is possible to trigger shallow soft wind drifts and dry sluffs on steep, upper elevation slopes, especially those facing north and east."
April,02,2014,"Yesterday's danger started at MODERATE and reached CONSIDERABLE by the afternoon...today's danger will start at CONSIDERABLE and trend toward MODERATE.  I'd expect human triggered avalanches to be probable on many aspects today with soft slabs and longer running loose snow avalanches likely.  Knowing the Wasatch backcountry, I'd be surprised if I didn't hear about a few people taking rides in avalanches today. 
If the sun comes out, all bets are off and both human and natural sluffs and storm snow slides will be all but certain."
April,01,2014,"We have an overall MODERATE danger in the backcountry that may spike at times with periods of heightened wind and precipitation today.  Human triggered wind drifts are possible and most prominent along the mid and upper elevation northerly through easterly aspects. Shallow sluffing of the new snow will be general in nature above about 8500' on all aspects.  
With 7 people caught and carried in various close calls over the past few days alone, you must stay focused and deliberate with your safe travel protocols, communication, and decision making."
March,31,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is CONSIDERABLE this morning on steep, wind drifted slopes.  Human triggered avalanches will be likely.  There is the potential for a few deeper slides, taking out 2 storms worth of snow.  Out of the wind affected terrain, the avalanche danger is MODERATE for triggering new snow sluffs and soft slabs on steep slopes of all aspects, especially with any daytime heating.
Go To Terrain:  safer options exist today on wind sheltered slopes less steep than about 35 degrees."
March,30,2014,The avalanche danger is increasing and may reach CONSIDERABLE mid day with continued wind and the onset of heavy snowfall.  The danger is most pronounced in the upper elevation northwest through east facing slopes with recent deposits of wind drifted snow.  The danger is MODERATE out of the windy areas.  Watch for instabilities within the anticipated new snow.
March,29,2014,The overall avalanche danger today is MODERATE.  Areas of concern are steep slopes with recent deposits of wind drifted snow as well as steep slopes that become excessively wet from daytime heating.
March,28,2014,"Avoid: 1) steep slopes with recent wind deposits, 2) slopes where the sun turns the snow wet (and stay out from underneath).
Safer terrain: terrain with non-wind drifted snow and gentler slopes with low consequences.
We base avalanche danger ratings on both probability and consequences.  Today, it will be fairly easy to trigger a sluff, wind slab or wet, loose avalanche but the snow is mostly soft and relatively shallow, which I will call a MODERATE danger.  You should avoid high consequence terrain today such as large paths or slopes with obstacles such as trees, rocks or cliffs and slopes that end in terrain traps like gullies."
March,27,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER will rise to CONSIDERABLE on steep, wind drifted slopes as the snow piles up today, with natural avalanches possible in areas receiving the additional 4 to 8” of snow accompanied by strong winds.  Human triggered avalanches will be likely on these steep wind drifted slopes.  Out of the wind affected terrain, the avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE for triggering new snow sluffs and soft slabs on steep slopes of all aspects.  A few wet, loose sluffs are possible in the Ogden area mountains at the lower elevations."
March,26,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is MODERATE for human triggered wet avalanches today, especially at the low and mid elevations.  Avoid steep slopes with new or old wet soggy snow, or that are “punchy”- where you are breaking through a thin frozen crust into wet snow. 
If you are in an area that receives more than about 6” of new snow combined with wind, it may be possible to trigger a few new wind drifts. These would be on upper elevation, northeast through southeasterly facing slopes."
March,25,2014,"We have a mostly LOW danger in the backcountry this morning that will rise to MODERATE with today's skyrocketing temps and light wind.  Cornices and glide slab potential should be other concerns for mountain travel today.  It'll be the warmest day yet - be off of and out from underneath the steep sun-drenched slopes by midday, if not earlier."
March,24,2014,"We have a mostly LOW danger in the backcountry.  Cornices, isolated pockets of shallow wind slab and usual springtime wet loose avalanche activity add to the general hazards of mountain travel.  Remember that there is little room for error when skiing and riding in radical terrain and even small sluffs can pose problems in no-fall zones."
March,23,2014,There is a generally LOW avalanche danger today.  Localized instabilities may be found in steep radical terrain with recent deposits of wind drifted snow.  Watch for minor wet loose snow avalanches on sunny slopes.
March,22,2014,There is a generally LOW avalanche danger today.  Localized instabilities may be found in steep radical terrain with recent deposits of wind drifted snow.
March,21,2014,"Most of the backcountry has a LOW avalanche danger.  Low danger never means no danger.  Today you could find:  1) lingering, shallow, wind slabs in upper elevation terrain, 2) shallow wet sluffs in steep terrain with daytime heating, 3) sensitive cornices along ridges."
March,20,2014,"Most of the backcountry has a LOW avalanche danger.  Pockets of MODERATE exist for developing wind drifts in the highest most exposed alpine terrain.  Of course, the danger on the steep sunlit slopes will rise to MODERATE with daytime heating."
March,19,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is mostly LOW early this morning, with a MODERATE DANGER on steep north through easterly facing slopes for old wind drifts from Monday and any new wind drifts that form today.  The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE for wet slides as the day heats up."
March,18,2014,"Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist in the steep open wind drifted terrain and most pronounced along the north to east to south facing slopes.  Human triggered avalanches are probable.  All other areas above 8000' will have a MODERATE danger with a note that the danger trend will point toward increasing stability as the day wears on. Collapsing and shooting cracks are key signs of instability.  
Confidence level in today's advisory is ""fair""...and I'd approach steep terrain with extra caution this morning.  Safe and better snow conditions can be found in the mid elevation wind sheltered terrain of all aspects on slopes up to 30 degrees in steepness."
March,17,2014,The avalanche danger is LOW this morning but will rise to MODERATE with some new snow and wind later today.  Watch for fresh drifts to form on the lee sides of the ridges and cross loaded terrain features.  Dropping cornices onto fresh drifts may give an idea of how sensitive they are.
March,16,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is mostly LOW, with a POCKETY MODERATE DANGER on any steep slope with drifts of wind-blown snow and for wet sluffs with daytime heating.    The wind drifts are most widespread in upper elevation terrain, on north through easterly facing slopes."
March,15,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is MODERATE on any steep slope with drifts of wind-blown snow.  While the drifts are most widespread in upper elevation terrain, there will be a few drifts on mid elevation slopes due to the strong winds.  Out of the wind affected terrain, the avalanche danger is mostly LOW."
March,14,2014,There is a mostly LOW avalanche danger today.  Watch for fresh wind slabs along the high lee sides of ridges.  Keep an eye on the sunny slopes as they heat up and move off of and out from under them if they get too wet.
March,13,2014,"There is an overall MODERATE avalanche danger for lingering wind slabs in upper elevation, wind exposed terrain and also for damp or wet sluffs in steep terrain with day time heating by the sun.  Be suspicious of steep slopes with recent wind drifts, which usually look smooth and rounded, and also steep slopes that are getting soggy in the heat of the day."
March,12,2014,"The danger will rise to MODERATE on the steep sunlit slopes today with daytime warming.  Natural and human triggered wet avalanches will are probable.  Avoid being on or beneath the steep confined sunny terrain during the heat of the day.  Isolated pockets of MODERATE danger exist in the mid to upper elevation slopes for occasional dry sluffs, shallow new wind drifts from the easterly winds, and lingering storm ""graupel slabs""."
March,11,2014,"The morning starts out with a CONSIDERABLE danger for steep wind drifted terrain, most pronounced in the mid and upper elevation northeast to southeast facing slopes.  Human triggered avalanches are probable in many areas, with wind drifts likely up to 18"" deep or more in heavily loaded terrain.  By the afternoon, the danger will trend toward MODERATE.  
The best and safest terrain today are one and the same - lower angle, mid-elevation (8-9500') northerly facing wind sheltered slopes...and it may be worth getting a bit later of a start today."
March,10,2014,"The overall avalanche danger is generally LOW today.  It is fairly unlikely that a person will trigger an avalanche unless they are in steep, radical terrain.  Continue to use safe travel protocol by only putting one person on a slope at a time and clear the runout zones."
March,09,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is mostly LOW this morning, but will rapidly rise to MODERATE with sun and daytime heating for wet sluffs on steep slopes on all aspects, and almost all elevations.  Get off of and out from under steep slopes when the snow becomes wet and soggy.  Early starts and finishes are key today. 
At the upper elevations, a person could trigger a shallow sluff, wind drift or break a cornice and go for a ride.  There is also the very isolated chance of triggering a deeper slab avalanche."
March,08,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is mostly LOW this morning, but will rapidly rise to MODERATE for wet sluffs on steep slopes around the compass, on almost all elevations.  Get off of and out from under steep slopes when the snow becomes wet and soggy. 
At the upper elevations, LOW danger doesn't mean NO danger - a person could trigger a shallow sluff or wind drift or break a cornice and go for a ride.  There is also the very isolated chance of triggering a slab avalanche."
March,07,2014,"A MODERATE avalanche danger exists in avalanche terrain for storm snow sluffs and slabs, lingering wind slabs from yesterday's wind and damp or wet sluffs from daytime heating by the sun."
March,06,2014,"A full MODERATE danger exists in the steep newly wind drifted terrain up high, the warm soggy and unsupportable areas in the mid and low elevations.  Human triggered avalanches are possible."
March,05,2014,"The danger will start off mostly LOW this morning, but will soon rise to MODERATE and then to CONSIDERABLE on the steepest sunlit slopes with daytime warming.  Natural and human triggered wet loose sluffs are a certainty. It's worth reading the fine print under the Wet Avalanche header.  Isolated pockets of wind slab, lingering storm slab, and deeper releases are unlikely yet possible in the alpine.  
Safe and excellent riding can be found in the northerly aspects on 35 degrees and less today."
March,04,2014,There is a MODERATE avalanche danger today.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  The avalanche danger may increase rapidly during any periods of intense snowfall.  Stay out from under avalanche terrain during these periods if they occur.  Anticipate shallow soft slabs on lee sides of ridges.
March,03,2014,"There is an overall MODERATE avalanche danger today.  Continue to anticipate stubborn wind slabs especially along the ridges and any terrain features.  A low probability - high consequence deep slab issue is still present in upper elevation, very steep slopes that have both a shallow underlying snowpack and a recent wind load."
March,02,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is CONSIDERABLE on any steep mid and upper elevation slope with recent drifts of wind-blown snow.  Out of the wind drifted terrain, there is an overall MODERATE avalanche danger on steep slopes for wet sluffs with any sun or daytime heating, new snow slides and the isolated chance of triggering a deeper slide."
March,01,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER is HIGH on and below all steep, upper elevation slopes and high ridgelines, especially those with drifts of wind-blown snow. Both spontaneous and easily triggered avalanches are likely.  Mid elevation slopes have a CONSIDERABLE danger.  The low elevation slopes have a MODERATE DANGER for wet slides.  Backcountry travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.
GO TO Terrain:  For people with expert level route finding and snow evaluation skills, head to terrain less steep than about 30 degrees, not connected to steeper slopes, and avoid all runout zones, as avalanches are running long distances."
February,28,2014,"The overall avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE (Level 3 / Orange) for sluffs and slabs within the new snow and for lingering wind slabs from yesterday as well as fresh wind slabs from expected strong winds later this afternoon and tonight.  The next, much stronger, portion of this storm tonight and Saturday should push the avalanche danger to HIGH.  I expect to issue an Avalanche Warning for tonight and Saturday for the mountains of northern and central Utah."
February,27,2014,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE today.  Watch for instabilities within the new snow as well as wind drifting of the new snow.  Anticipate wind loaded slopes on northwest through southeast facing slopes along the ridges.  Keep in mind that the avalanche danger rises rapidly during periods of heavy snowfall.
February,26,2014,"The most widespread concern will be wet loose avalanching with sun and daytime warming on the steep east to south to west facing slopes of all elevations...and the low to mid-elevation northerly-facing terrain.  Isolated areas exist where deeper slabs may release, but these are generally confined to steep upper elevation northerly slopes in thin rocky terrain."
February,25,2014,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE today which means human triggered avalanches are possible.  Southerly facing slopes as well as all aspects at lower elevations should be monitored for daytime heating.  Upper elevation north through east facing slopes have an isolated potential for a larger more dangerous avalanche.
February,24,2014,"The overall AVALANCHE DANGER is MODERATE on all mid and upper elevation slopes.

Wet loose sluffs are expected with daytime heating, on east through south through westerly facing slopes.
There is an isolated chance of triggering a high consequence, deep slab avalanche on mid to upper elevation, north through easterly facing slope, in shallower snowpack areas. 
Wind drifts could be triggered along the highest ridgelines"
February,23,2014,"The danger for both human triggered and natural avalanches is MODERATE for shallow wind drifts and loose wet and dry sluffs in steeper terrain at the mid and upper elevations.  These are high probability, low consequence unless in unforgiving terrain.  Manageable avalanches for experienced backcountry travelers.
A ""scary"" MODERATE exists for triggering a deeper slab avalanche in thin, steep, rocky terrain in predominantly northwest to east to southeast facing slopes above about 8000'.  These are low probability, high consequence avalanches.  Unmanageable avalanches for even the most experienced backcountry travelers."
February,22,2014,"Most terrain has an overall MODERATE danger for increasingly stubborn wind drifts and loose snow avalanches.   Isolated areas of CONSIDERABLE dot the landscape on steep northwest through east facing terrain above about 8000'.  Plenty areas of LOW danger and excellent riding and recreating exist in sheltered terrain on slopes less steep than 35 degrees with nothing steeper above or adjacent to you.  Slope angle is key here.  
Remember that even small avalanches can have significant consequences if riding in extreme terrain."
February,21,2014,"The avalanche danger is mostly MODERATE (yellow, Level 2) with areas of CONSIDERABLE (orange, Level 3) especially for the possibility of large, deep slabs on upper elevation northwest through east facing slopes. You may also find some sensitive wind slabs in upper elevation terrain and some shallow, wet sluffs on steep, sun exposed slopes today. 
You can always find safe terrain on slopes less than 30 degrees not locally connected to steeper terrain."
February,20,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER remains CONSIDERABLE on all steep mid and upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through southeast for triggering a fresh wind drift or a deep slab avalanche breaking to the ground.
Once again, the “GO TO” terrain is wind sheltered slopes less steep than about 34 degrees, that are not below or adjacent to a steeper slope."
February,19,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER remains CONSIDERABLE on all mid and upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through southeast for triggering a deep slab avalanche breaking to the ground.   In addition, the avalanche danger will increase to CONSIDERABLE this afternoon and tonight on any steep slope with fresh drifts of wind-blown snow.  Rapidly changing conditions often catch people unaware, and are when avalanche accidents occur."
February,18,2014,The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE.  Large and dangerous human triggered avalanches are likely on steep slopes that face west through north through east.  Give the snow some more time to settle before chancing it.
February,17,2014,"TODAY IS ACCIDENT WEATHER!  Nice weather, CONTINUED DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS, and many people headed to the hills for the holiday - this is a classic combination for an avalanche accident.  Continue to avoid being on or below all slopes of around 30 degrees in steepness or greater on all aspects and elevations."
February,16,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER IS HIGH for deep slabs breaking deep and wide, especially on the northwest through easterly facing slopes.  The danger is CONSIDERABLE for wet slides on all aspects at elevations below about 8,500' and for fresh wind slabs and cornices in the upper elevation wind exposed terrain.   Backcountry travelers should avoid slopes steeper than 30 degrees and avalanche run out zones.  Those without good avalanche skills should avoid the backcountry today.  Remember, this includes those leaving the exit gates of ski areas."
February,15,2014,"The AVALANCHE DANGER IS HIGH on all mid and upper elevation slopes – for deep slabs breaking to the ground on the northwest through easterly facing slopes and for wet avalanches on most aspects.  Wet slides will increase with daytime heating on all aspects.   Avoid travel in historic run out zones.  Low elevation slopes have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger for wet avalanches and for run out zones.
Leaving the exit gates of one of the mountain resorts? You are stepping through that gate into HIGH danger terrain.  Those without expert level avalanche skills, including terrain and snowpack evaluation, should avoid backcountry travel and Sunday."
February,14,2014,"The avalanche danger is at least a CONSIDERABLE on all aspects and elevations on any slope approaching 35 degrees and steeper.   Areas of HIGH DANGER exist on the north through easterly facing slopes above about 9500’, especially on and below slopes newly loaded with drifts of wind blown snow.
Leaving the exit gates of one of the mountain resorts? You are stepping through that gate into CONSIDERABLE TO HIGH danger.  Those without expert level avalanche skills, including terrain and snowpack evaluation, should avoid backcountry travel today and Saturday."
February,13,2014,"Most terrain has an overall CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger.  Areas of HIGH danger exist in north through east facing terrain above about 8000'.  Leaving the exit gates of one of the mountain resorts?  You are stepping through that gate into CONSIDERABLE TO HIGH danger.  
Got your avalanche beacon, shovel, and probe?  Good - but it's like wearing your seat belt with a head-on collision with an 18-wheeler.  
Avalanche danger exists on all aspects and elevations on any slope approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  It may be possible to be in the flats and remotely trigger the 4-5' deep avalanche on top of you.  Runout zones are to be avoided as well."
February,12,2014,DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS REMAIN!!  The avalanche danger will again be on the rise over the next couple of days.  Human triggered avalanches are likely on many slopes and almost certain on steep upper elevation north through east facing slopes.  The overall avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE but areas of HIGH DANGER remain.  Those without expert level avalanche skills are urged to avoid going into the mountains at this time.
February,11,2014,VERY DANGEROUS AVALANCHE CONDITIONS REMAIN.  HUMAN TRIGGERED AVALANCHES ARE LIKELY AGAIN TODAY.  Overall there is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger but the danger is still HIGH on upper elevation north through east facing slopes.  Avoid being on or below slopes of 30 degrees and steeper.
February,10,2014,"Very dangerous avalanche conditions continue...
The danger remains HIGH in most areas of the Wasatch Range at all aspects and elevations. Backcountry travel is not recommended.  This includes people leaving ski area exit gates and people recreating in low elevation terrain where your normally don't expect avalanches.  Remember avalanches can descend from high above you.  Stay off of, and out from underneath, any slope steeper than 30 degrees.
We need your help to spread about the HIGH avalanche danger to friends, family, social media - you name it.  We don't need any more tragic fatalities."
February,09,2014,"These are dangerous times.
The danger remains HIGH to EXTREME in many areas of the Wasatch Range.  All aspects and elevations continue to be dangerous. Backcountry travel is not recommended.  Those looking exiting mountain resorts into the ""Sidecountry"" are entering a HIGH to EXTREME danger.  With naturals again likely, you will be in danger even in the flats beneath steep avalanche paths...and it may be possible to pull the avalanche down on top of you.  
We need your help to relay the word that avalanche conditions are HIGH to EXTREME - friends, family, social media - you name it.  Thanks -"
February,08,2014,"A HIGH AVALANCHE DANGER WILL BORDER ON EXTREME THIS WEEKEND.  I'M EXPECTING A GOOD NATURAL AND HUMAN TRIGGERED AVALANCHE CYCLE WITH LONGER RUNNING AVALANCHES EXPECTED IN MANY AREAS.  AVALANCHE RUNOUT ZONES ARE TO BE AVOIDED.  AVALANCHES MAY BE TRIGGERED AT A DISTANCE AND FROM BELOW.  ICE CLIMBING NOT RECOMMENDED.  
THOSE WITHOUT EXPERT LEVEL AVALANCHE AND ROUTE FINDING SKILLS SHOULD AVOID THE BACKCOUNTRY THIS WEEKEND.  SAFE AND EXCELLENT STEEP RIDING CAN BE ENJOYED AT ANY ONE OF OUR WORLD CLASS MOUNTAIN RESORTS."
February,07,2014,"Expect rapidly rising avalanche danger today and through the weekend as new snow accumulates and the wind picks up.  You should avoid all avalanche terrain.  This means stay off of, and out from underneath, slopes of about 30 degrees or steeper.  The avalanche danger today is Orange (Considerable) and you can expect it to rise to Red (High) danger by Saturday and through the weekend."
February,06,2014,"The avalanche danger starts out MODERATE this morning and will be on the rise through the weekend.  Keep a close eye on any wind drifted snow today.  The wind may drift enough snow to make the avalanche danger CONSIDERABLE later today.  Buried persistent weak layers of snow may collapse under the weight of a person today especially in shallow snowpack areas.  Any wind loading in these areas will enhance the persistent slab avalanche concern.
ANTICIPATE RISING AVALANCHE DANGER THROUGH THE WEEKEND."
February,05,2014,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE today on slopes of 35 degrees or steeper.  Be mindful of loose snow avalanches within the newest snow.  Continue to watch for recent wind drifts and test them when possible to check their sensitivity.  Keep in mind that more dangerous persistent slab avalanches are possible especially in thinner snowpack areas.
February,04,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on most mid and upper elevation slopes steeper than about 35 degrees.  The chief concern is sensitive new wind drifts – avoid any steep slope that is wind drifted, and be alert for any increase in wind speed where you are, which will rapidly deepen these wind slabs.  Substantial loose snow sluffs can be triggered – treat these with respect, and avoid being caught and carried.   Lastly, there is still the isolated chance of triggering a deeper slab avalanche, mostly on north through east facing slopes at the upper elevations."
February,03,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on most mid and upper elevation slopes steeper than about 35 degrees.  Avalanche problems are:

Sensitive, cracky wind drifts, especially widespread along the high ridgelines.
Loose snow sluffs on the shady slopes
Wet loose sluffs if the sun has enough time to heat the snow before thicker clouds come in.
The isolate chance of triggering a deeper slab avalanche, on west through north through east."
February,02,2014,"We have an overall MODERATE danger in the backcountry on all aspects above 7000' for loose snow avalanches. If and when the sun comes out, the danger of continued loose snow avalanching will rise accordingly on the steepest sunlit (east to south to west facing) slopes..with natural releases likely. In this case, avoid runout zones where naturals may occur and where others may be above."
February,01,2014,"An overall MODERATE danger exists in the backcountry today.  Expect to find sluffs and occasional soft slabs within the new snow 6 inches to a foot deep.  These will be mostly easy to trigger in steep terrain but generally smaller and softer.   Also if the sun pokes through the clouds, the new snow can turn damp or wet in a hurry so watch for damp or wet sluffs in steep, sun exposed terrain."
January,31,2014,"An overall MODERATE danger exists in the backcountry today.  Human triggered slides up to 12-18"" deep are possible on steep northwest to north to southeast facing slopes above about 7500'...and may be triggered at a distance.  Below 7500' - and more pronounced on the west to north to east facing slopes, it'll be possible to gouge down into the rain-soaked wet snow.  
I wouldn't be surprised to see a close call today.  Manage your terrain well - keep sight of your partners, move through suspect terrain one-at-a-time, have good communication.  
Excellent safe, primo riding can be found above 8000' on slopes of 25 degrees to approaching 35 degrees in steepness.  Slope angle is key."
January,30,2014,"Dangerous avalanche conditions exist - the avalanche danger is HIGH on the steep wind drifted slopes along the upper elevation ridge lines, and CONSIDERABLE on all other steep mid and upper elevation slopes and most low elevation slopes.  Natural avalanches are possible and human-triggered slides likely.  Backcountry travel on and below steep slopes should be avoided.  People without excellent route finding and snow evaluation skills should stay out of the backcountry. 
Many Utah ice climbs are in the tracks of avalanche paths, or will be subject to wet sluffs low down."
January,29,2014,"The danger will rise dramatically over the next several days.  The danger will rise to MODERATE today for 

fresh wind drifts, growing in size and sensitivity by day's end, particularly in the mid and upper elevation northeast to southeast facing terrain
wet loose sluffs, particularly in the steep shady terrain in the lower elevations and up to perhaps 8500'.      ICE CLIMBING NOT RECOMMENDED TODAY

....with the overall danger rising toward CONSIDERABLE by tonight and perhaps HIGH by tomorrow.  Mind the AVALANCHE WATCH for today...we may be in AVALANCHE WARNING criteria for tomorrow -"
January,28,2014,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, with Pockets of MODERATE danger on steep, upper elevation slopes, facing north through east.   On these slopes, human triggered avalanches are possible.  With the upcoming storm, anticipate a rising avalanche danger through the end of the week."
January,27,2014,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, with Pockets of MODERATE danger on steep, upper elevation slopes, facing north through east.   On these slopes, human triggered avalanches are possible.  Continue to use caution and travel one at a time if you are getting into steep terrain."
January,26,2014,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, with Pockets of MODERATE danger on steep, upper elevation slopes, facing north through east.   On these slopes you have a low probability of triggering a large and dangerous avalanche.
The snow on the steep, sunny slopes will heat today, and if it becomes wet and sloppy where you are, switch to a cooler aspect. 
The avalanche danger is greater in the Logan and western Uintas area mountains, so check out their specific forecasts."
January,25,2014,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, with Pockets of MODERATE danger on steep, upper elevation slopes, facing north through east.   On these slopes, there is a very isolated chance of triggering a slab avalanche. 
The snow on the steep, sunny slopes will heat today, and if it becomes wet and sloppy where you are, switch to a cooler aspect. 
The avalanche danger is greater in the Logan and western Uintas area mountains, so check out their specific forecasts."
January,24,2014,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW, with pockets of MODERATE on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through east.   On these slopes, the concern is triggering a slab avalanche.  Avoiding terrain steeper than about 35 degrees will reduce your chance of triggering a slide.  If you are traveling further afield, the avalanche danger is significantly higher in the Logan, western Uintas and Manti Skyline area mountains, so check out their specific forecasts."
January,23,2014,The majority of the terrain in the backcountry has a LOW avalanche danger and conditions are generally safe.  There is a scattered or 'pockety' MODERATE avalanche danger in the higher elevations on slopes approaching 40 degrees or steeper.  Watch for fresh wind slabs on west facing slopes as well as crossloading on all aspects.
January,22,2014,"Many areas have a LOW danger.  Localized areas of MODERATE danger exist on steep west to north to southeasterly facing slopes above about 8000'.  Human triggered slides 1-3' deep are unlikely, yet possible in specific areas.  If you want to avoid even these odds, choose slopes well less than 35 degrees in steepness with  nothing steeper above.  The danger of wet avalanche activity will, like clockwork, rise to MODERATE on the steep sunlit slopes with daytime warming."
January,21,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on mid and upper elevation slopes.  On slopes facing northwest through southeast, the concern is triggering a deeper slide breaking on facets.  Avoiding terrain steeper than 35 degrees and thinner snowpack areas can reduce your chance of triggering a slide.
On slopes facing east through south through west, the avalanche danger of wet sluffs increases to MODERATE each day with heating."
January,20,2014,The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  You may still be able to trigger a dangerous persistent slab avalanche on slopes of 35 degrees and steeper above around 9000 feet that face northwest through northeast through southeast.  The danger of wet loose snow avalanches on sunny slopes will increase with daytime heating.  Be careful not to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
January,19,2014,"The overall danger is MODERATE.  Human triggered avalanches up to 1-4' deep are possible in specific terrain. The danger is most pronounced on steep northwest through north through southeast facing slopes above about 8000' on slopes approaching 35 degrees in steepness.  It may be possible to collapse the slope and trigger them from a distance.  Remember that while most accidents occur at Considerable, many over the years have occurred at Moderate  - particularly when there is a persistent weak layer involved - as there is now.
Diving in to steep northwest to easterly facing terrain?  Ensure your partners will be quick to Switch To Receive.  
The smart and savvy backcountry traveler will look for mid-elevation sheltered terrain well less than 35 degrees in steepness with nothing steeper above."
January,18,2014,"Most areas have a MODERATE avalanche danger.  Areas of CONSIDERABLE danger exist in localized terrain within the northwest through east facing slopes above about 8000'.  While natural avalanches are unlikely, human triggered slides, even remotely triggered slides, are possible, pulling out 1-3' deep or more and a couple hundred feet wide.  Wet avalanche activity will rise toward MODERATE with daytime heating on the steep sunlit slopes. 
Diving in to steep northwest to east facing terrain?  Be good to make sure your partners will be quick to Switch To Receive.  
The smart and savvy backcountry traveler will look for mid-elevation sheltered terrain well less than 35 degrees in steepness with nothing steeper above."
January,17,2014,"The avalanche danger of triggering a deep slab avalanche is CONSIDERABLE on steep northwest through easterly facing slopes, above about 9,000’, and MODERATE on the same aspects at the mid elevations.  The unpredictable nature of these avalanches makes conservative decision making important.  The avalanche danger for wet slides and cornices breaking will rise to MODERATE as the day heats up.
Safer shady terrain to recreate on are slopes less steep than about 35 degrees, not directly below or connected to the side of a steeper slope and the sunny slopes before they heat too much."
January,16,2014,"The avalanche danger remains at Level 3 (CONSIDERABLE) – large avalanches are possible in specific terrain.  Although the probability of triggering an avalanche is small, if you do, the avalanche will be very large, deep and difficult to survive.   This deep slab problem is most pronounced on northwest through north through easterly facing slopes, above about 9,500.  The avalanche danger for wet slides will rise to MODERATE on and below steep sunny slopes as the day heats up.
Even on the more dangerous aspects, you can always find much safer terrain on slopes less steep than about 33 degrees, not directly below or connected to the side of a steeper slope."
January,15,2014,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE – large avalanches are possible in specific terrain.  The danger is higher in the Farmington Canyon area where numerous slides were triggered yesterday.  The uncertainty on a specific slope is great – not every steep slope will slide, but if it does, a slide has the potential to be very large.  This deep slab problem is most pronounced on northwest through easterly facing slopes, above about 8,500.  The avalanche danger for wet slides will rise to MODERATE on and below steep sunny slopes as the day heats up.
Safer terrain to recreate on are slopes less steep than about 35 degrees, not directly below or connected to the side of a steeper slope."
January,14,2014,"A CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger remains.  Human triggered avalanches are likely on slopes approaching 35 degrees in steepness above 8500 feet and most pronounced on northwest through east facing slopes.  The danger is more scattered and pockety but still exists on west facing slopes as well as southeast facing slopes.  Although the peak of avalanche instability has passed, this is accident weather with lingering danger and nice weather to lure us in."
January,13,2014,Very dangerous avalanche conditions continue through today.  There is a CONSIDERABLE overall avalanche danger.  Large human triggered avalanches are likely.  Pay attention to what is uphill of you as you may trigger an avalanche from below.  It is wise to avoid all steep wind loaded slopes again today.
January,12,2014,"Areas of HIGH DANGER exist in the backcountry right now.  With additional snow and wind, I'm expecting more natural avalanches to occur, with human triggered slides likely 2-4' deep on many slopes on the north through east side of the compass.  Avalanches may be triggered at a distance or from below...with any slide potentially stepping down more deeply, creating unsurvivable avalanche conditions. 
Expert backcountry travelers will head to the mid-elevation slopes well less than 35 degrees in steepness today.  Seeking steep terrain with the new powder?  Head to one of our world class mountain resorts."
January,11,2014,"A STRONG CONSIDERABLE DANGER WILL AGAIN RISE TO HIGH BY THE AFTERNOON INTO TOMORROW.  
Tree and bone snapping natural, natural cornice fall, and human triggered avalanches are likely on steep terrain and can be triggered from the flats below.  These are dangerous conditions that will ramp up even higher with this next storm.  
Avoid being on or beneath steep terrain.  Expert route finding essential.  Choose low angled terrain with nothing steeper above or adjacent to you.  Best to enjoy the new snow at our world class mountain resorts - 
I expect the next dramatic avalanche cycle to begin overnight into tomorrow."
January,10,2014,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on steep, wind drifted slopes at the upper elevations, and CONSIDERABLE on most other steep mid and upper elevation slopes.  Dangerous avalanche conditions exist: New snow and wind slab avalanches are a given today on steep slopes.  Slides also have the potential to break out into the weak layers mid pack and near the ground, creating very large avalanches.  Backcountry travel is only recommended for people with excellent route finding and snowpack evaluation skills, who can stay off of and out from underneath steep slopes
Many of the Wasatch ice climbs are in avalanche paths – be aware of what is above you.    Natural avalanches can release and hit you."
January,09,2014,"It is a day of increasing avalanche danger.  This morning’s MODERATE avalanche danger will increase to CONSIDERABLE this afternoon, with heavier snowfall and stronger winds. 

New snow slides will become easy to trigger on steep slopes of all aspects, with naturals possible. 
Wind drifts will increase in size and should be avoided on steep slopes.  Drifts will be most widespread at the upper elevations.
Slab avalanches breaking on persistent weak layer - in isolated places, a smaller slide may step down, breaking out a large dangerous slide failing on a more deeply buried faceted weak layer. 

Solution: once again back off the steep slopes, and enjoy the lower angle slopes where the great powder is filling in the old tracks."
January,08,2014,INCREASING AVALANCHE DANGER THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  For today there is a MODERATE avalanche danger.  Human triggered avalanches are possible in localized areas.  Avoid slopes over 35 degrees in steepness with recent deposits of wind drifted snow on lee sides of the higher ridges.  Keep in mind that there is an abundance of very weak faceted snow that is being covered up with new snow and wind drifted snow.
January,07,2014,Most terrain has a LOW danger.  Pockets of MODERATE danger exist above 8500'.   Avalanches may be possible in isolated areas or extreme terrain. Continue to practice safe travel protocol in steep terrain.
January,06,2014,"There is an overall Level 2 (MODERATE) (Yellow) avalanche danger today. Be cautious of steep slopes with recent wind deposits, which will usually look smooth and rounded.  Also, fresh cornices may be sensitive along the upper elevation ridge lines.  Never approach a drop off along a ridge without either first checking it out from safe angle or wearing a belay rope."
January,05,2014,There is an overall MODERATE avalanche danger today.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  Watch for areas with recent deposits of wind drifted snow mainly on the more easterly facing slopes.  Keep in mind that you may find crossloaded terrain features on many aspects.  The danger is more pronounced along the upper elevation ridges.
January,04,2014,There is an overall MODERATE avalanche danger today.  Human triggered avalanches are possible.  Watch for fresh drifts on the northeast through southeast facing aspects.  Watch for crossloaded pockets of wind drifted snow on all aspects.
January,03,2014,"A MODERATE danger exists on mid and upper elevation, west through north through easterly facing slopes. Large avalanches are possible in isolated areas.   Low probability, high consequence. What's your level of acceptable risk? Also don't overlook the recent wind-drifting - continue to avoid the smooth, rounded recent deposits of wind drifted snow above about 8000' (on primarily north through east through southeast facing slopes)."
January,02,2014,"A MODERATE danger exists on mid and upper elevation, west through north through easterly facing slopes. Large avalanches are possible in isolated areas.   Low probability, high consequence. What's your level of acceptable risk? Also don't overlook the recent wind-drifting - continue to avoid the smooth, rounded recent deposits of wind drifted snow (on primarily north through east through southeast facing slopes)."
January,01,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on mid and upper elevation, west through north through easterly facing slopes. Large avalanche are possible in isolated areas (Danger Scale).   The chance of triggering a slide is not high, but the consequences if you get caught are – a deep slide, breaking out near the ground.  Avoiding travel on steep slopes facing west through north through east avoids most of the problem slopes.    Wind drifts will be more wide spread today, and should be avoided on all steep slopes.  A triggered wind drift has the potential to release a deeper, larger slide."
December,31,2014,"We have areas of CONSIDERABLE danger in the backcountry today. You'll find sensitive wind drifts in unusual areas today - along the high alpine north to west to south facing terrain as well as down along the foothills and mouths of canyons where there's drifted snow.  Dangerous slabs 1-3' deep may also be triggered on west to north to east facing terrain in the mid and upper elevations.  
Safe and excellent powder can be found on all aspects and elevations on slopes gentler than 30 degrees as long as nothing steeper exists above."
December,30,2014,"A CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger will once again be in place for the northerly facing steep higher terrain.  Dangerous human triggered hard slab avalanches are likely.  Pay attention to any drifting that may occur along the high terrain if the east wind increases more than forecast.  This could form slabs on west facing terrain where we don't usually see them.  Also, people without good avalanche assessment skills should avoid steep snow covered slopes in the foothills where wind is drifting snow."
December,29,2014,"The avalanche danger is Moderate (Yellow, Level 2) today.  Within the new snow you will see sluffs and occasional soft slabs.  There's still the chance to trigger a large, deep avalanche on upper elevation slopes that face northwest, north, northeast and east.  Tomorrow, watch for wind drifting from canyon winds and along the foothills."
December,28,2014,"The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through east, where winds will be building sensitive drifts of snow.  In very isolated places - upper elevation slopes facing northwest through southeast - in the Ogden area mountains, these drifts could overload buried weak layers, and larger slides 2 to 3 feet deep are possible.  In addition, avoid any steep slopes with recent drifts of wind-blown snow, which you will find at both mid and upper elevations.
Lower avalanche danger and excellent riding conditions will be found in wind sheltered terrain, and on the low angle slopes of all aspects."
December,27,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through east, where in isolated places, larger slides can still be triggered on slopes of approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  Avoid all steep slopes with recent drifts of wind blown snow.
Take advantage of the lower avalanche danger on the more southerly facing slopes and excellent riding conditions on the low angle slopes of all aspects."
December,26,2014,A pockety CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger remains above 9500 feet on northwest through east facing slopes.  Human triggered avalanches are likely in these areas especially with a recent wind load.  Keeping slope angles below 35 degrees will greatly decrease your chances for triggering an avalanche.
December,25,2014,We have a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger in the backcountry that will be most active and pronounced in the morning hours and during periods of high snowfall intensity.  Collapsing and shooting cracks are tell-tale signs of instability.  You can find safe and world-class face-shots and over-the-hood riding on many low angle slopes today.  Have a safe Christmas folks!
December,24,2014,Pockets of CONSIDERABLE danger exist on the west to north to southeast facing terrain above about 9000'.  Human triggered avalanches up to 3' deep are possible and may be triggered at a distance.  Watch for overnight wind drifts along the higher elevations and any potential for wet loose sluffs on the steepest sun-kissed terrain.
December,23,2014,There is a CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger today on slopes steeper than 30 degrees most pronounced in terrain above 8000 feet.  Dangerous human triggered avalanches are likely today.  Don't let the nice weather and lack of obvious clues lure you into steep terrain.
December,22,2014,"The avalanche danger remains HIGH above about 8,000' on all aspects, especially on slopes with recent wind deposits.  Backcountry travelers should avoid all slopes steeper than 30 degrees and stay out from underneath steeper terrain.  If you want steeper terrain today, and you're a skier or boarder, go to a resort where ski patrollers work hard to make the snowpack much safer."
December,21,2014,The avalanche danger is HIGH today.  People should avoid being on or below any steep slope.  Stay out of terrain traps such as steep walled gullies at all elevations.
December,20,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE today on any slope with new drifts of wind blown snow.   These cracky wind drifts will be most widespread on the north through easterly facing slopes, in the upper elevation terrain.  Also avoid getting caught or knocked off balance in one of the long running sluffs can be triggered on steep slopes facing northwest through northeast at the upper elevations.  In these same places, there is an isolated chance of triggering an old hard wind drift.  Avalanche Watch issued - rapidly increasing avalanche danger Sunday thorough Monday."
December,19,2014,Most areas will have a LOW avalanche danger today.  Keep in mind the snow surface may be prone to sluffing on all steep northerly facing slopes.  Use slope cuts prior diving into a slope.  Prod any fresh drifts and kick small cornices to get a feel if the new drifts will crack.
December,18,2014,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW, with pockets of MODERATE danger on steep northerly through northeast facing slopes at the upper elevations.  There, it is possible to trigger an isolated slab avalanche – a buried old hard wind drift.  The thin snow cover means any ride in an avalanche would a dangerous proposition, hitting unforgiving rocks and logs.  Shallow, loose snow sluffs can also be started on steep, shady slopes."
December,17,2014,Pockets of MODERATE avalanche danger exist for lingering wind drifts as well as loose snow/point-release avalanches.  Shooting cracks on the slope from your weight will be an obvious clue of instability.  It's possible that an initiated avalanche in northwest to easterly facing terrain may pull out an older wind drift sitting on faceted snow from last week.
December,16,2014,A MODERATE avalanche danger exists for overnight and developing wind drifts as well as loose snow/point-release avalanches.  Shooting cracks on the slope from your weight will be an obvious clue of instability.  It's possible that an initiated avalanche in northwest to easterly facing terrain may pull out an older wind drift sitting on faceted snow from last week.
December,15,2014,"There is a MODERATE danger of human triggered avalanches from old pre-storm wind slabs deposited on weak faceted snow.  These are cleverly concealed by the new snow.  You could find localized problems mainly above 8,500' on NW, N, NE and E facing slopes."
December,14,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep slopes facing northwest through east at the mid and upper elevations, especially in areas that received the greater snow amounts.  Old hard wind slabs hidden beneath the new snow could crack out under the weight of a person, sending you for a ride.  Sluffs and new soft wind drifts can also be also triggered, especially on steep, shady slopes.  The snow cover is still very shallow and rugged ground cover makes even a short ride in a slide a dangerous proposition."
December,13,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep slopes facing north through north through easterly at the mid and upper elevations.  Old hard wind slabs hidden beneath the new snow are hard to identify, and could crack out under the weight of a person, sending you for a ride.  Shallow sluffs and new soft wind drifts can also be also triggered, especially on steep, shady slopes."
December,12,2014,"Avoid all slopes steeper than about 30 degrees with recent deposits of wind drifted snow.  They will look smooth and rounded and often sound hollow or feel ""slabby."" there is a MODERATE danger of human triggered avalanches on any slope with recent wind deposits.  You can find safer terrain on wind eroded slopes or all slopes less steep than 30 degrees including locally-connected terrain."
December,11,2014,Most terrain has an overall LOW avalanche danger. Continue to follow safe backcountry protocol by only putting one person on a slope at a time. Anticipate pockety and shallow wind drifts in the alpine as well as minor wet and dry sluffing of the snow surface in the steeper terrain.
December,10,2014,Most terrain has an overall LOW avalanche danger.  Continue to follow safe backcountry protocol by only putting one person on a slope at a time. Anticipate sluffing of the snow surface on the steeper high elevation shady terrain.
December,09,2014,The avalanche danger is LOW in most locations today.  Continue to follow safe backcountry protocol by only putting one person on a slope at a time.  Evaluate your terrain and the snowpack on that terrain carefully.  Anticipate sluffing of the snow surface on the steeper high elevation shady terrain.
December,08,2014,The avalanche danger is LOW in most locations today.  Continue to follow safe backcountry protocol by only putting one person on a slope at a time.  Evaluate your terrain and the snowpack on that terrain carefully.
December,07,2014,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW, though on steep upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through northeast there is an isolated chance you could trigger a slide. A slide on a hard icy crust or hitting a rock or stump are also hazards of this year's early season backcountry travel."
December,06,2014,"The avalanche danger in the Ogden area mountains is mostly LOW, though it may still be possible to trigger a slide on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through northeast.  It could be a shallow old wind drift or ice crust, on possibly a slide breaking near the ground on facets."
December,05,2014,Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.
December,04,2014,Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  A MODERATE danger exists in the highest northwest through east facing terrain where you may find some sensitive fresh wind drifts or the chance for triggering a persistent slab avalanche.  Continue to evaluate the upper elevation terrain and snowpack carefully.
December,03,2014,"An overall MODERATE danger exists in the backcountry for human triggered slides 1-3' deep and a couple hundred feet wide.  These Low-Probability/High-Consequence bone-snappers are found predominantly on west to north to east facing slopes above 8500'.  Cornice drops, previous tracks, and slope cuts tend to provide little to no information for these conditions.  These slides may also be triggered at a distance.  The danger associated with any new snow and wind may rise toward Moderate but will be generally harmless and short-lived."
December,02,2014,"A MODERATE danger exist in the northwest to north to northeast facing terrain above about 9000'.   We're trending toward a Low-Probability-High-Consequence regime where uncertainty remains high.  Uncertainty in my book = conservative decision making.
Probably the best and safest terrain would be mid elevation shady terrain no steeper than 30 degrees or so (with nothing steeper above)."
December,01,2014,There is a MODERATE avalanche danger today.  Watch for areas where the new snow may be blown into deeper drifts which may be sensitive to the weight of a person.  Also keep in mind that there may be weak snow near the ground in the highest northerly facing terrain.  Approach that terrain with a lot of caution.
November,30,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE in the Ogden area mountains.   Also avoid any steep slope with fresh drifts of wind-blown snow, and check out the bonding of the new snow to the old.  Be aware that the old snow sitting on the ground has weakened on the northerly facing slopes, and if the snow piles up more than expected, it will become sensitive."
November,29,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep, upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through east, with any drifts of wind blown snow.  Avalanches can still break to the ground.   If you are searching for the softer snow on these shady slopes, choose low angle terrain, with slopes gentler than about 30 degrees in steepness with nothing steep directly above you.  Also avoid any fresh drifts of wind-blown snow at the mid elevations and steep slopes with punchy, damp snow."
November,28,2014,"Continue to be suspicious of:
Northwest, north, northeast and east facing slopes approaching 9,500' or higher, steeper than 30 degrees. Avalanche danger is Level 2 (Moderate, yellow) on these aspects, which means ""Dangerous conditions.  Make conservative terrain choices.""
Safer terrain:
Slopes less than 30 degrees.  If you want steeper terrain, head to southerly facing slopes or lower elevation slopes where no depth hoar formed earlier this season."
November,27,2014,There is a MODERATE avalanche danger in the Ogden area mountains today.  There is a minor chance you could trigger a slab avalanche in the highest north facing terrain.  Anticipate minor wet activity also.
November,26,2014,The avalanche danger is MODERATE in the upper elevation northwest through east facing slopes that are steeper than about 35 degrees above around 9500 feet.  Watch for new wind drifts and sensitive cornices along upper elevation lee slopes.  Also keep in mind the sunny slopes and lower elevations will become wet and may produce loose snow slides.
November,25,2014,"The winds will be a game changer.  A CONSIDERABLE danger exists on all wind drifted slopes at the mid and upper elevations.  I expect both natural and human triggered avalanches today.  They'll be most pronounced on north through east through south facing slopes with any triggered slide potentially stepping to the ground 3-4' deep in suspect terrain.  Avalanches may still be triggered remotely, even from perceived safe terrain beneath the slope.
The danger scale says ""Experts Only"" for Considerable danger - and all the experts I know aren't yet sticking their necks out in steep terrain."
November,24,2014,"The season has hardly begun but we have a CONSIDERABLE AVALANCHE DANGER.  Steep backcountry terrain should be avoided.  
The danger is most pronounced on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through east, where the snow is landing on the weak pre-existing snow.     REMEMBER it is possible to trigger an avalanche while skiing or riding below the steep slope.  'EXPERTS ONLY' - All the experts I know are staying on low angle terrain with nothing steeper above."
November,23,2014,"The avalanche danger is HIGH on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through southeast, where the snow is landing on the old, weak sugary facets.  A CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger exists on steep mid elevation slopes, facing northwest through north through east.   AVOID travel on and below these slopes, as it is possible to trigger slides remotely from a distance and from below.  Taking a ride in an early season avalanche is particularly dangerous, as the chance of hitting a rock is high.  If you do choose to head out today, choose slopes gentler than 30 degrees in steepness with nothing above."
November,22,2014,"The avalanche danger will be increasing over the next 24 hours – and the rose represents the avalanche danger for late this afternoon and tonight. 

This morning - the avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep, upper elevation, northwest, north and northeasterly facing slopes with fresh drifts of wind-blown snow. 
This afternoon and tonight - the avalanche danger will rise to CONSIDERABLE on mid and upper elevation slopes facing west through north through east.  AVOID travel on and below these slopes, as it will become possible to trigger slides from a distance and from below.  Natural avalanches may be possible.  In addition, avoid any of the developing wind drifts on all steep slopes."
November,21,2014,"Although the avalanche danger today is mostly LOW, I expect the avalanche danger on Saturday and through the weekend to be CONSIDERABLE TO HIGH, especially on upper elevation, northerly facing slopes.  I would urge everyone to just avoid avalanche terrain in the backcountry this weekend.  If you get out, go to gentle terrain out from underneath steeper terrain above or go to terrain that does not have snow on the right now."
November,17,2014,There is hardly enough snow in the Ogden and Provo area mountains for much winter recreation right now.  We will only be updating these regions advisories as conditions warrant.  Please check the SALT LAKE REGION AVALANCHE ADVISORY for avalanche information.
November,16,2014,"The avalanche danger is LOW, but small wind drifts could be triggered in mid and upper elevation terrain. These dense, cracky drifts of wind-blown snow should be avoided on all steep slopes. And remember, none of the mountain resorts are open for the season and you must treat the snow as a backcountry snowpack.  Also, it is still a very shallow snowpack, and you could be injured by hitting rocks and stumps."
November,15,2014,"The avalanche danger is LOW, but small wind drifts could be triggered in mid and upper elevation terrain.  These dense, cracky drifts of wind-blown snow should be avoided on all steep slopes.  And remember, none of the mountain resorts are open for the season and you must treat the snow as a backcountry snowpack."
November,14,2014,"Although we have a LOW avalanche danger today, it will almost certainly rise to at least MODERATE Saturday through the weekend on steep slopes above about 9,500' that face northwest, north and northeast.
We'll update the avalanche forecast as the snow arrives and through the weekend."
November,13,2014,"No avalanche danger exists at the moment.  However, with a storm in the forecast for today through Saturday, new snow amounts may be great enough to increase the avalanche danger on the upper elevation northwest, north and northeasterly facing slopes that have a shallow base of weak, faceted snow. 
We'll update the avalanche forecast as the snow arrives and through the weekend."
November,12,2014,"No avalanche danger exists at the moment.  However, with a storm in the forecast for Thursday through Saturday, new snow amounts may be great enough to increase the avalanche danger on the upper elevation slopes. 
We'll update the avalanche forecast as the snow arrives and through the weekend."
