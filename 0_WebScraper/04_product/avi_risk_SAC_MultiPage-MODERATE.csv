16,February,2025,Backcountry travelers unintentionally triggered large avalanches both Friday and Saturday in sheltered terrain below treeline terrain. You could trigger a similar avalanche today that fails several feet below the snow surface and breaks wider than expected. Consider choosing low angle terrain or S-SW-W aspects to help reduce the chances of getting caught in a large avalanche today.,SAC
12,February,2025,"Triggering a large avalanche is becoming more difficult, but still possible especially in the southern portion of the forecast region from Carson Pass to Ebbetts Pass.  Weak layers multiple feet deep in the snowpack could still be triggered by backcountry users today.  Avalanche danger is expected to increase as a strong Sierra storm enters our forecast region tonight.",SAC
11,February,2025,"Large to very large human triggered avalanches remain possible today, especially in the southern portion of the forecast region from Carson Pass to Ebbetts Pass.  Weak layers multiple feet deep in the snowpack could still be triggered by backcountry travelers.  Sticking to lower angle terrain away from steeper slopes will be a way to avoid this avalanche problem. ",SAC
10,February,2025,"Backcountry travelers unintentionally triggered very large avalanches over the past two days. Similar avalanches could be triggered again today, especially in the Carson Pass and Ebbetts Pass portions of the forecast area near 8,000 ft and higher. Opting for lower-angle, low-consequence terrain can help reduce the chances of getting caught in a large avalanche today.",SAC
9,February,2025,"Backcountry travelers unintentionally triggered large avalanches yesterday that failed on weak snow several feet below the snow surface. Similar avalanches could be triggered today, especially in the eastern and southern portions of the forecast area near 8,000 ft and higher. Opting for lower-angle, low-consequence terrain can help reduce the chances of getting caught in a large avalanche today.",SAC
8,February,2025,"Large avalanches that fail on weak snow several feet below the surface may remain possible today, especially in the eastern and southern parts of the forecast area above about 8,000 ft. These could occur near ridges, gullies, and open slopes filled in with wind-blown snow or in more sheltered terrain. Opting for lower-angle, low-consequence terrain can help reduce the chances of triggering a large, unexpected avalanche. ",SAC
31,January,2025,"New snow, rain, and wind will make avalanches possible today. Watch out for steep slopes near ridges, in gullies, and on open slopes that get filled in with wind-blown snow. Avalanches of wet snow may also be possible on any slope where rain falls on snow today. Conditions will change quickly as this storm impacts the region. It will take constant effort to carefully reassess the snow and terrain as you travel in today's rapidly changing conditions. 
Expect the avalanche danger to continue to increase tonight and tomorrow as the storm intensifies. ",SAC
30,January,2025,"Wet snow is expected to form today with sunny skies, warmer temperatures, and lighter winds.  In areas that received the most snow from last weekend's storm in the eastern and southern portions of the forecast region, wet loose instabilities will be possible today with MODERATE avalanche danger.  In the vast majority of the forecast area that received limited new snow, LOW avalanche danger will exist today with minor wet snow instabilities expected.  Use caution today if traveling in areas where the surface snow becomes deep and wet.  ",SAC
29,January,2025,"Sunny skies, warmer temperatures, and decreasing winds are expected to form wet snow on sunny slopes today.  This wet snow could become problematic where recent storm snow exists from this past weekend's storm on the Eastern and Southern portions of the forecast region.  Use caution if traveling in these areas as daytime warming occurs and surface snow becomes deep and wet.  ",SAC
28,January,2025,"Strong winds continue today with slabs of wind blown snow possible in gully features, near ridges, and in open areas.  This avalanche problem is mainly focused on the eastern and southern portions of the forecast region where the most recent storm snow exists.  Look for areas where unstable snow could accumulate and avoid these areas of concern.",SAC
27,January,2025,"Currently, the areas of greatest avalanche hazard exist along the eastern side of the forecast area. Avalanches remain possible today in places where wind-blown snow has filled in near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes near and above treeline. Below treeline, some small dry loose sluffs could be triggered by backcountry travelers.",SAC
26,January,2025,"Avalanches are possible today in places where wind-blown snow has filled near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes near and above treeline. Below treeline, some small dry loose sluffs could be triggered by backcountry travelers. For today, the areas of greatest avalanche hazard are expected in places where 4 or more inches of new snow has accumulated.",SAC
25,January,2025,"Most avalanches should remain unlikely this morning, but avalanches could become possible later today and tonight as wind-blown snow fills in areas near ridges, gullies, and open slopes near and above treeline. Pay attention to changing conditions during this storm, and watch out for slopes where blowing snow is piling up.",SAC
8,January,2025,"Strong NE winds have filled in areas near ridges, gullies, and open slopes with stiff, wind-blown snow. Triggering an avalanche may remain possible in these areas. Traveling in the trees or other places sheltered from the wind can help reduce your exposure to avalanches and may lead to softer snow. ",SAC
7,January,2025,"Strong winds today will blow any lingering soft snow around, filling in new areas near ridges, gullies, and open slopes with stiff, wind-blown snow. In these areas, triggering an avalanche could be possible.  Blowing and drifting snow can help identify problematic areas. Moving away from these places into areas sheltered from the wind can help reduce your exposure to avalanches and may lead to softer snow. ",SAC
6,January,2025,"Recent winds will continue creating slabs of wind blown snow in new areas.  These slabs of wind blown snow will most likely exist just below ridges, in gully features, and on open slopes.  Use caution if traveling in areas where this problem exists. ",SAC
5,January,2025,"Multiple avalanches were reported yesterday.  Slabs of wind blown snow that formed during our recent storm may continue to be reactive today near ridges, in gully features, and on open slopes.  Identify where these wind slabs exist and move around any areas of concern.  ",SAC
4,January,2025,"Cold overnight air temperatures may have slowed down new snow stabilization.  Anticipate that you could still trigger an avalanche today, especially near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes that were filled in yesterday with wind drifted snow. Sluffs may remain an issue today in steep wind protected areas.",SAC
2,January,2025,"More precipitation occurred than forecast over the past 24 hours, with rain on snow extending into upper elevation terrain. Triggering a wet snow avalanche is possible today in a variety of areas. Triggering a slab avalanche is possible in upper elevation terrain that has been filled in with wind drifted snow.",SAC
30,December,2024,"Gale force winds during yesterday's storm have created slabs of wind blown snow.  These slabs could remain reactive today in gully features, along ridges, and in open areas.  Use caution when traveling around these areas of concern.",SAC
28,December,2024,"You might still be able to trigger a large avalanche today above about 8,000' to 8,500'. The areas of greatest avalanche hazard exist near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes where wind-drifted snow was deposited Thursday-Thursday night. Move cautiously around slopes that are below cornices or wind drifts.",SAC
27,December,2024,"Triggering an avalanche remains possible today in a variety of areas. Above the rain/snow line, avalanche hazard is focused near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes where wind-drifted snow has deposited. Below the rain/snow line, wet snow avalanches remain possible in steep areas on any aspect.",SAC
26,December,2024,"Triggering an avalanche is possible today near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes where wind-drifted snow has deposited. Slopes that hold locally deeper, wind-deposited snow have the greatest avalanche hazard today. Move around these areas with caution.",SAC
25,December,2024,"Triggering an avalanche remains possible near ridges, gullies, and open slopes where wind-blown snow has piled up. Loose sluffs of storm snow could also happen on steep slopes in wind-protected areas. Travel plans that skirt windy places and avoid terrain traps can help reduce your exposure to avalanches and their potential consequences. ",SAC
21,December,2024,"Today's wind, light rain, and snow aren't expected to do much to change avalanche conditions. Triggering a large avalanche in an isolated area has become unlikely, but is certainly not impossible due to the current snowpack structure. Best practice backcountry travel techniques associated with normal caution are advised.",SAC
20,December,2024, There remains a low likelihood of triggering a large avalanche in isolated areas. Travel plans that select simple terrain combined with backcountry travel practices that use wide safety margins may help reduce the consequences of an unexpected avalanche involvement.,SAC
19,December,2024,"As evidenced by several large snowpack collapses triggered yesterday, triggering a large avalanche remains possible in isolated areas. If you see signs of unstable snow or have doubts about a slope, move on to a different option. Travel plans that select simple terrain combined with backcountry travel practices that use wide safety margins may help reduce the consequences of an avalanche accident.",SAC
18,December,2024,"Avalanche activity continues to decrease. However, triggering an avalanche may remain possible on an isolated steep slope where weak snow lurks below the storm snow or where wind-blown snow has piled up near ridges, gullies, and other exposed terrain. If you see signs of unstable snow or have doubts about a slope, move on to a different option. Travel plans that use simple terrain and create safety margins may help reduce the consequences of an avalanche. ",SAC
17,December,2024,"People could still trigger large, dangerous avalanches today, especially in areas where weak snow lurks below the storm snow on steep slopes and where wind-blown snow has piled up near ridges, gullies, and other exposed terrain. Look for any potential signs of unstable snow like recent avalanches, cracking, collapsing, or even just feeling soft snow below more dense snow. Use travel plans that provide large safety buffers around any places where unstable snow might still exist. ",SAC
29,November,2024,"In specific terrain, you still might trigger an isolated, but sizable avalanche due to lingering poor snowpack structure. Choose terrain intentionally, assessing the potential consequences of an unexpected avalanche. At this time, it remains wise to select terrain not capable of producing large avalanches.",SAC
28,November,2024,"You could trigger an avalanche today that is either a surface instability formed from blowing and drifting snow following a wind shift, or a deeper instability associated with weaker old snow at the bottom of the snowpack. Each require a different approach to terrain management. Intentional route planning and very specific terrain selection are recommended. This forecast was issued on Wednesday Nov 27. The next update will occur on Friday, Nov 29.",SAC

Each require a different approach to terrain management. Intentional route planning and very specific terrain selection are recommended. The next update to this forecast will occur on Friday, Nov 29.",SAC
25,November,2024,"An approaching storm will impact our forecast region starting today with heavy snow and strong winds.  In areas where weak snow continues to exist near the base of the snowpack, large avalanches remain possible as extra load gets added to these weak layers.  Strong winds will also create slabs of wind blown snow in open areas.  Avalanche danger is expected to quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE this evening, as the storm intensifies.  ",SAC
24,November,2024,The recent storm has deposited dense heavy snow on top of a weak and shallow snowpack.  Triggering large avalanches that could bury or injure a person remain possible today on many slopes.  Use caution if traveling near avalanche terrain where these avalanche problems exist.,SAC
22,November,2024,"You could trigger an avalanche large enough to bury a person today in certain areas, especially at and below treeline. This is where problematic old weak snow exists below the new snow. Conditions are highly variable around the forecast area with uneven distributions of new snow and rain.
A period of HIGH avalanche danger is expected tonight and may continue into tomorrow.",SAC
