January 8, 2021 at 6:58 In most areas, triggering an avalanche is becoming more difficult. Some exceptions include areas with a shallow snowpack where old weak snow remains closer to the surface or places where new snow and wind may form small slabs of drifted snow today especially in the northern part of the forecast area. In these places, human-triggered avalanches may remain possible. The avalanche danger remains MODERATE at all elevations. 
"
1,"
January 6, 2021 at 6:59 Persistent slab and wind slab avalanche problems remain possible today.  MODERATE avalanche danger will exist at all elevations.  Unstable snow continues to exist in some areas of the forecast region.
"
2,"
January 3, 2021 at 6:57 The likelihood of triggering an avalanche has gradually decreased but the consequences have not. Isolated areas of unstable snow linger due to a persistent slab avalanche problem. Any isolated avalanches today are likely to be larger than expected. MODERATE avalanche danger lingers at all elevations. Increasing avalanche danger is expected tomorrow.
"
3,"
January 2, 2021 at 6:58 Triggering an avalanche on steep slopes still remains possible today especially in places with a shallower snowpack and old weak snow below the surface. Some fragile slabs of wind drifted snow may also exist in wind-affected terrain. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Conservative terrain choices are recommended when traveling in the backcountry.
"

December 31, 2020 at 6:59 Triggering avalanche on steep slopes still remains possible especially in wind affected terrain where new slabs of wind drifted snow exist or in more sheltered terrain where the old snow below the surface remains weak. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Conservative terrain choices are recommended when traveling in the backcountry. This forecast will be updated on Jan. 2 by 7 am. 
"
5,"
December 30, 2020 at 6:59 Persistent slab and wind slab avalanche problems continue for our area.  It remains possible to trigger a large avalanche in our forecast region due to our poor snowpack structure.  MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations.  Conservative terrain choices are recommended when traveling in the backcountry.
"
6,"
December 22, 2020 at 6:53 MODERATE avalanche danger continues for our area.  A persistent slab avalanche problem remains a concern in below and near treeline areas.  Increased winds overnight will make unstable wind slabs in near and above treeline terrain.  Human triggered avalanches remain possible today.  
"
7,"
December 21, 2020 at 6:55 Spatial variability for the persistent slab avalanche problem is increasing. This makes it more difficult to observe evidence of instability prior to triggering a persistent slab avalanche. Triggering a large avalanche remains possible, especially near treeline and below treeline. Additionally, small unstable slabs of wind drifted snow (wind slabs) exist above treeline and near treeline. MODERATE avalanche danger continues at all elevations.
"
8,"
December 20, 2020 at 6:55 Unstable conditions are persisting, longer than what often occurs in this region. Trigging a large avalanche remains possible, especially near treeline and below treeline. Additionally, small unstable slabs of wind drifted snow may exist above treeline and near treeline. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. This is not the time to try and outsmart the snowpack. Stick with mellow terrain for now, waiting patiently for the right set of conditions to move into bigger, steeper terrain at another time.
"
9,"
December 19, 2020 at 6:59 Within the snowpack, lurks old weak sugary snow that can barely support the soft slabs of recent snow. People recreating on steep slopes where this weak snow exists could break this layer possibly triggering large avalanches. This problem is widespread near and below treeline and isolated above treeline. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Traveling on slopes less steep than 30 degrees that are not connected to steeper slopes can provide fun snow and better safety margins.
"
10,"
December 18, 2020 at 7:00 Today's biggest concerns exist on steep slopes where old weak sugary snow barely supports the soft slabs of recent snow above it. People could tip the balance and break this layer possibly triggering avalanches. This problem is widespread near and below treeline and isolated above treeline. Shifting winds have also moved slabs of drifted snow into new places at upper elevations. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. More accidents happen at MODERATE and CONSIDERABLE than any other danger ratings.
"
11,"
December 13, 2020 at 7:00 Avalanche danger will rapidly increase from midday onwards. Isolated and still unstable slabs of wind drifted snow from yesterday (wind slabs) will be a problem this morning and added to this afternoon with increasing size and distribution. A persistent slab avalanche problem is expected to develop during today's storm. Avalanche danger will increase from MODERATE danger this morning to CONSIDERABLE this afternoon. HIGH avalanche danger is possible tonight if the upper end of the forecast snowfall amount is reached.
"
12,"
December 12, 2020 at 7:00 The new snow has made the rocks and other obstacles harder to see and easier to hit. This storm's new snow and wind have also added potential avalanche concerns. Unstable slabs of wind drifted snow (wind slabs) may exist on open slopes near ridgelines on almost any aspect today. Human triggered avalanches will be possible. MODERATE avalanche danger exists in near and above treeline terrain. 
"

This afternoon MODERATE avalanche danger will form at all elevations. This is the last avalanche forecast for the season.
"
14,"
May 2, 2020 at 6:54 A good overnight refreeze and cooler weather should allow a longer window for supportable snow today, but avalanches of loose wet snow may still be possible this afternoon once the surface crust melts.

"
18,"
April 28, 2020 at 6:47 Once the surface crust from last night's refreeze melts away, a loose wet avalanche problem will be present. Cornice failures remain an additional hazard. MODERATE avalanche danger will exist today at all elevations.
"
19,"
April 27, 2020 at 7:00 Warm sunny weather today will make short work of last night's refreeze and avalanches of loose wet snow will be possible as soon as the surface crust melts. Cornice failures also remain possible today. MODERATE avalanche danger will quickly form at all elevations.
"
20,"
April 26, 2020 at 6:51 Last night's refreeze won't last long in today's sunny warm weather. Once it melts, avalanches of loose wet snow and cornice failures will be possible. MODERATE avalanche danger will quickly form at all elevations today.
"
21,"
April 25, 2020 at 6:59 Warm spring weather will quickly melt through whatever refreeze occurred last night and allow avalanches of loose wet snow to become possible before midday. Cornice fall is also a possibility. MODERATE avalanche danger will form at all elevations once the surface crust melts, exposing areas of deep wet snow.
"
22,"
April 24, 2020 at 6:55 A weak refreeze of the snow surface is expected again today with above freezing overnight temperatures and clear skies.  Loose wet avalanches and cornice fall will be possible as rapid warming occurs.  MODERATE avalanche danger will exist today at all elevations.
"
23,"
April 23, 2020 at 6:55 Above freezing overnight temperatures along with mostly clear skies will provide a weak refreeze of the snow surface.  Rapid warming starting early this morning will make loose wet avalanches and cornice fall avalanche problems for today.  MODERATE avalanche danger will exist at all elevations.
"
24,"
April 22, 2020 at 6:42 Last night's snow surface refreeze is expected to be relatively weak.

MODERATE avalanche danger will form rapidly at all elevations once the surface crust melts away, exposing areas of deep wet snow.
"
25,"
April 21, 2020 at 6:49 Firm surface conditions early this morning will give way to snow surface melt and the possibility of loose wet snow avalanches at all elevations as the day progresses. MODERATE avalanche danger will exist today at all elevations once the surface crust melts away, exposing areas of deep wet snow.
"
26,"
April 20, 2020 at 6:57 Sunshine this morning and rain showers this afternoon should provide enough warming for avalanches of loose wet snow to become possible on mid to low elevation slopes again today. At upper elevations where this afternoon's precipitation falls as snow, loose wet avalanches may remain unlikely. Slabs of wet snow may also still warrant concern in some areas. The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE at mid to low elevations and should remain LOW at upper elevations today. 
"
27,"
April 19, 2020 at 7:00 Spring weather with some sunshine should provide enough warming for avalanches of loose wet snow to become possible on steep slopes again today. Slabs of wet snow may also still warrant concern in some areas. The avalanche danger is MODERATE today.

"
29,"
April 16, 2020 at 6:56 Sunny and warm conditions are expected today with the chance of showers and thunderstorms this afternoon.  Loose wet and wet slab avalanche problems will continue to be a concern.  MODERATE avalanche danger will exist as rapid daytime warming occurs.
"
30,"
April 15, 2020 at 6:46 Rapid warming conditions and snow surface melt will raise concern for a variety of wet snow avalanche problems today including loose wet, wet slab, and cornice collapse. MODERATE avalanche danger is expected to form quickly today for all elevations, further increasing to CONSIDERABLE danger during the afternoon hours.
"
31,"
April 11, 2020 at 7:27 Warm sunny weather today will cause sluffs of wet snow to become a problem at all elevations as the day warms up.

"
40,"
March 29, 2020 at 7:00 Slab avalanches 1 to 3 ft deep that break on a weak layer of buried surface hoar remain possible at all elevations today.

"
41,"
March 28, 2020 at 7:00 People triggered slab avalanches 1 to 3 ft deep that broke on a weak layer of buried surface hoar yesterday. This persistent slab problem exists at all elevations.

Choosing conservative terrain can help avoid getting caught by this unusual problem. MODERATE avalanche danger will continue.
"
42,"
March 27, 2020 at 7:00 Buried surface hoar beneath our recent storm snow has been found in the forecast region creating a persistent slab avalanche problem.

MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations.
"
46,"
March 22, 2020 at 7:03 Pesky ENE winds have left small fresh slabs of wind drifted snow near upper elevation ridgelines. Daytime warming and sunshine may also allow some loose wet avalanche problems to form on lower elevation sunny slopes. On top of these two problems, an unlikely but not impossible deep slab problem still may exist on some isolated near and below treeline slopes. MODERATE avalanche danger continues.
"
47,"

"
158,"
December 10, 2018 at 6:59 Some wind slabs may exist on top of a buried weak layer in some areas in very wind-exposed near and above treeline terrain. The avalanche danger is MODERATE. Human triggered avalanches may be possible today.
"
159,"
December 9, 2018 at 6:57 Increased winds during the night and continued windy conditions today may mean that growing wind slabs could exist on top of a buried weak layer. The avalanche danger is MODERATE in near and above treeline terrain. Human triggered avalanches may be possible today.
"
160,"
December 8, 2018 at 6:45 Avalanche danger has risen to MODERATE danger near treeline and above treeline. Increased SW winds last night may have created new wind slabs and loaded the Dec 4 buried surface hoar layer. LOW avalanche danger exists below treeline.
"
161,"
December 4, 2018 at 6:59 The avalanche danger will remain at MODERATE today due to the possibility of unstable storm slabs still lingering in some areas.

"
167,"
April 19, 2018 at 6:57 Periods of intense April sun this morning may cause enough warming for some small loose wet instabilities to form in isolated areas. MODERATE avalanche danger would result from this expected warming. If the forecasted cloud cover materializes sooner than expected, loose wet instabilities may be unlikely and less avalanche danger would exist. 
"
168,"
April 17, 2018 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations today due to rapid warming allowing loose wet avalanches to become possible and lingering wind slabs on wind-loaded slopes. The April sun will help destabilize the snowpack and conditions could change in a matter of minutes once the sun hits the new snow. Once any signs of warming snow or wet snow exist it is time to move to colder aspects, lower angle slopes, or switch an activity that does not involve snow.
"
169,"
April 15, 2018 at 6:48 MODERATE avalanche danger will exist for most of today at all elevations due to a loose wet avalanche problem.

"
171,"
April 13, 2018 at 6:59 The avalanche danger is MODERATE today. Rapid warming will make loose wet avalanches a more widespread problem today. In addition to the loose wet avalanches that are possible today, some small wind slabs may exist near ridgelines. 
"
172,"
April 12, 2018 at 6:50 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations due to wind slab problems and some possible storm slab avalanche problems.

"
173,"
April 11, 2018 at 6:51 The avalanche danger may rise to MODERATE during the day if enough warming occurs for loose wet avalanches to become possible. Once the storm arrives over the forecast area this evening the avalanche danger will quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE during the night due to newly formed wind slabs and storm slabs. Slab avalanche activity will be an issue tonight and slab instabilities will linger into tomorrow. 
"
174,"
April 10, 2018 at 6:51 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist above, near, and below treeline. Poor conditions for snow surface refreeze occurred last night. Avoid travel in or below avalanche terrain in areas where the snow surface is marginally unsupportable to unsupportable wet snow.
"
175,"
April 9, 2018 at 6:52 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger will exist today at all elevations. As last night's snow surface refreeze melts away, loose wet avalanches will become possible.

In addtion, deep slab avalanches that would be very large and destructive and would have severe consequences may become possible tonight and tomorrow.
"
178,"
April 5, 2018 at 6:56 MODERATE avalanche danger will exist at all elevations due to loose wet avalanche problems becoming possible again today. Rain on snow and warm temperatures will allow this problem to continue through the night.

"
181,"
April 2, 2018 at 6:48 MODERATE avalanche danger will occur at all elevations today as a loose wet avalanche problem develops in response to daytime warming. Evaluate snow surface supportability on an ongoing basis and avoid avalanche terrain in areas where marginally supportable to unsupportable wet snow exists.
"
182,"
April 1, 2018 at 6:50 MODERATE avalanche danger will develop at all elevations as a loose wet avalanche problem forms in response to daytime warming. Timing for travel in avalanche terrain is critical. In wet snow conditions, slopes can switch from stable to unstable in as little as 20 minutes.
"
183,"
March 31, 2018 at 6:59 The avalanche danger will increase to MODERATE as the day warms up. Loose wet avalanche problems will become possible. 
"
184,"

"
190,"
March 20, 2018 at 6:58 MODERATE avalanche danger will continue today due to loose wet and deep slab avalanche problems.  Loose wet avalanche activity will be possible at all elevations as rapid warming occurs and rain becomes possible this afternoon.  Deep slab avalanches remain possible in isolated areas of the forecast region.  Avalanche danger is expected to increase over the next few days as a larger storm impacts our area.
"
191,"
March 19, 2018 at 6:58 MODERATE avalanche danger continues today for all elevations. Loose wet avalanches may occur. An unexpected deep slab avalanche was remotely skier triggered yesterday leading to a high degree of uncertainty. Strive to create larger than normal margins of safety while traveling in or below avalanche terrain today.
"
192,"
March 18, 2018 at 6:58 MODERATE avalanche danger exists today at all elevations due to a combination of wind slab and loose wet avalanche problems. Backcountry travelers should not be surprised by the occurrence of a human triggered avalanche today. Areas of unstable snow will exist within surrounding greater areas of seemingly stable snow. Take active measures to avoid the specific terrain features where unstable snow is most likely to exist.
"
193,"
March 15, 2018 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger will exist during the day due to wind slabs formed in the last 24 hours. The avalanche danger will quickly increase as the next storm impacts the forecast area starting this afternoon. The avalanche danger should rise to HIGH tonight night as wind slab and storm slab avalanche problems become widespread. Human triggered wind slabs will become very likely and storm slabs will become likely during the night. Travel in or near avalanche terrain is not recommended.
"
194,"
March 8, 2018 at 6:59 Even though deep slab avalanches have become more difficult to trigger and are now unlikely in most areas, they may remain possible in some specific terrain. The consequences of such an avalanche would still be dire. Some loose wet avalanche problems may also become possible today. These issues will keep the avalanche danger at MODERATE. 
"
195,"
March 4, 2018 at 6:50 Avalanche danger is MODERATE for all elevations. Even though snowpack stability is improving, human triggered avalanches remain possible. Keep in mind that most recreational avalanche accidents happen during periods of MODERATE or CONSIDERABLE danger. Wind slab, deep slab, and loose wet avalanche problems may be encountered today. Areas of unstable snow will exist within greater surrounding areas of seemingly stable snow.
"
196,"
February 25, 2018 at 6:54 MODERATE avalanche danger still exists in near and above treeline terrain due to lingering wind slabs as well as some potential new wind slabs. While these wind slabs should have become more difficult to trigger, human-triggered avalanches remain possible. 
"
197,"
February 24, 2018 at 6:52 MODERATE avalanche danger lingers near and above treeline. LOW avalanche danger exists below treeline.

Signs of instability may not readily present themselves today unless you are actively assessing for them.
"
199,"
February 22, 2018 at 6:56 MODERATE avalanche danger will exist today in most portions of the forecast area at all elevations. CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger may develop near treeline and above treeline in any areas that receive close to or more than a foot of new snow. Wind slabs are the main avalanche problem of concern. Isolated storm slabs may form in the areas of greatest new snow accumulation. Factor in how decreasing snow stability will affect travel plans and terrain selection as the day progresses.
"
200,"
January 30, 2018 at 7:00 As the day warms up, the avalanche danger will increase to MODERATE due to the potential for loose wet avalanches.  A few isolated persistent slabs may also linger on some near and below treeline slopes, especially in the Carson Pass and Ebbetts Pass areas. 
"
201,"
January 29, 2018 at 7:00 The avalanche danger remains MODERATE due to some wind slabs lingering in near and above treeline terrain and the potential for loose wet avalanches as the day warms up.  Some isolated persistent slabs may also linger in some near and below treeline areas, especially in the Carson Pass and Ebbetts Pass regions. 
"
202,"
January 28, 2018 at 7:00 The avalanche danger remains MODERATE due to old and new wind slabs in near and above treeline terrain. Some loose wet avalanches may become possible as the day warms up.  Unlikely but not impossible persistent slabs may also linger in below treeline areas, especially in the Carson Pass region. 
"
203,"
January 27, 2018 at 6:56 Avalanche danger is MODERATE near treeline and above treeline where another round of wind slab formation is expected to have occurred last night. Below treeline avalanche danger is LOW where triggering an avalanche on a regional scale is unlikely but not impossible. Persistent slab and loose wet avalanche problems have a high degree of uncertainty today.
	 
"
204,"
January 26, 2018 at 6:45 MODERATE avalanche danger exists above and below treeline due to a combination of wind slab and persistent slab avalanche problems. Significant uncertainly exists regarding the persistent slabs due to a change in weak layer of concern, isolated distribution, and a lack of data. Do not let an absence of signs of instability below treeline create a sense of security that discounts the possibility of an isolated avalanche problem.
"
205,"
January 22, 2018 at 6:54 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations due to newly formed wind slabs and unlikely but not impossible persistent slab avalanche problems lingering in isolated areas. In the unlikely event that an isolated human-triggered persistent slab avalanche does occur, it could be large with significant consequences.
"
206,"
January 21, 2018 at 7:00 Lingering isolated areas of persistent slab avalanche problems will keep the avalanche danger at MODERATE in near and below treeline terrain. If an isolated human triggered persistent slab avalanche does occur, it could be large with significant consequences. Above treeline, avalanche danger is LOW.
"
207,"
January 20, 2018 at 6:58 MODERATE avalanche danger exists near treeline and below treeline due to isolated areas of a persistent slab avalanche problem. Any isolated human triggered persistent slab avalanches could be large with significant consequences. Above treeline, avalanche danger is LOW.
"
208,"
January 9, 2018 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists below 9000 ft. and human triggered avalanches will remain possible today due to lingering persistent slabs, loose wet instabilities, and some wind slab problems. In areas above 9000 ft. where more of the precipitation fell as snow and in areas that received the most snow accumulation CONSIDERABLE danger exists and some human triggered wind slabs or persistent slabs may be likely. Careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making are essential.
"
209,"
January 5, 2018 at 7:01 MODERATE avalanche danger is increasing towards CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger at all elevations as rain and wet snow continue. Loose wet, persistent slab, and wind slab avalanche problems are a concern over the next 24 hours.
"
210,"
January 4, 2018 at 6:59 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations today due to isolated persistent slabs in areas where a slab layer exists above loose weak snow and rain on snow creating loose wet instabilities. Human-triggered avalanches will be possible today. While most avalanches should remain small, the shallow snowpack and numerous exposed obstacles can provide large consequences for any size avalanche. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Identify where instabilities may exist and avoid those areas in favor of less steep slopes.
"
211,"
January 3, 2018 at 6:52 Avalanche activity will remain unlikely in most areas today except in isolated areas where a slab layer exists above loose weak snow (facets) where small isolated human-triggered persistent slab avalanches may be possible. As a result, the avalanche danger remains at MODERATE at all elevations. As rain and snow begin to fall this evening some loose wet instabilities may start to form during the night and some of those isolated persistent slabs may become easier to trigger.
"
212,"
January 2, 2018 at 6:52 While avalanche activity is unlikely in most areas, the snowpack continues to weaken and human-triggered persistent slab avalanches remain possible in isolated areas where a slab layer exists above loose weak sugary snow (facets). As a result, the avalanche danger remains at MODERATE at all elevations. Identify and avoid areas where a slab layer exists on top of the persistent weak layer of faceted snow. 
"
213,"
December 30, 2017 at 6:51 Avalanche danger is MODERATE for all elevations. In isolated areas, the snowpack has weakened to the point that human triggered avalanches are now possible. Have a group discussion highlighting how managing a persistent slab avalanche problem is different from managing a wind slab avalanche problem. Adjust terrain selection and travel tactics accordingly.
"
214,"
December 29, 2017 at 6:59 Avalanche danger is MODERATE for all elevations. Human triggered avalanches have become possible in isolated areas. Curious as to how the avalanche danger went from LOW to MODERATE without a storm? Read up on the terms faceted snow and persistent slab.
"
215,"
December 28, 2017 at 6:40 While avalanches remain unlikely in most areas, the avalanche danger has increased to MODERATE due to a weakening snowpack allowing persistent slab problems to exist in specific areas. Human-triggered avalanches may be possible today in terrain with the right combination of a slab layer resting on top of a persistent weak layer of loose weak snow. This combination does not exist everywhere. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and identify where slabs may exist on top of a persistent weak layer.
"
216,"
December 27, 2017 at 7:00 While avalanches remain unlikely in most areas, the avalanche danger has increased to MODERATE due to a stubborn persistent slab problem that exists in specific areas. Human triggered avalanches may be possible today in terrain where harder snow exists on top of a persistent weak layer of looser weaker snow. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and identify areas where slabs may exist on top of a persistent weak layer. 
"
217,"
December 21, 2017 at 6:58 MODERATE avalanche danger exists in near and above treeline terrain due to yesterday's lingering wind slabs and today's newly formed wind slabs. Small loose dry avalanches could also occur on steep slopes where loose unconsolidated surface snow exists in more sheltered terrain. Human triggered avalanches remain possible today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify areas where avalanche problems exist; and avoid those areas.
"
218,"
December 20, 2017 at 6:58 Human triggered avalanches are possible today at all elevations. Some of these could involve enough snow to bury a person in areas where the most new snow accumulates. Today's avalanche problems include wind slabs, storm slabs, and loose dry avalanches. MODERATE avalanche danger will exist at all elevations. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify areas where avalanche problems exist; and avoid those areas.
"
219,"
December 9, 2017 at 6:54 Hard wind slabs continue to pose a difficult to trigger avalanche problem keeping MODERATE avalanche danger ongoing in some near and above treeline areas. Below treeline, avalanche danger is LOW. These near and above treeline wind slabs are very dense and could allow a person to travel well out onto the slab, becoming fully committed to the slope prior to avalanche occurrence. It is also plausible that several to numerous individuals could travel a slope before the snowpack fails.
"
220,"
December 8, 2017 at 6:46 Hard wind slabs continue to pose an avalanche problem leading to MODERATE avalanche danger in some near and above treeline areas. Below treeline, avalanche danger is LOW.
"
221,"
December 7, 2017 at 6:48 MODERATE danger continues in near and above treeline terrain where hard wind slabs exist above older weaker snow. While these hard slabs may be difficult to trigger, human-triggered avalanches remain possible. If these slabs do break, they would likely fail above the trigger or after that person committed to the slope. Identify where wind slabs exist and avoid them. Firm or icy surfaces where arresting a fall would be challenging also exist on some exposed near and above treeline terrain.
"
222,"
December 6, 2017 at 6:40 MODERATE avalanche danger will continue in near and above treeline terrain due to the hard wind slabs created by the strong NE winds. While these hard slabs may be difficult to trigger, human-triggered avalanches remain possible today. Identify where wind slabs exist and avoid steep wind-loaded terrain. Firm, scoured, or icy surfaces where arresting a fall would be challenging also exist on exposed near and above treeline terrain.
"
223,"
December 5, 2017 at 6:49 MODERATE avalanche danger will continue to exist in near and above treeline terrain due to new wind slabs created by the strong NE winds and older wind slabs leftover from the recent storm. Human triggered avalanches remain possible. Identify where wind slabs exist and avoid steep wind-loaded terrain. Firm, scoured, or icy surfaces could also exist on exposed near and above treeline terrain.
"
224,"
April 23, 2017 at 6:43 MODERATE avalanche danger exists this morning due to the potential for loose wet and wet slab avalanche problems. In areas that received little to no snow surface refreeze last night these problems are possible beginning early this morning. In areas where a refreeze did occur these avalanche problems will develop as daytime warming occurs, accelerating once cloud cover clears from the area today. Avoid travel in avalanche terrain once wet surface snow begins to loose supportability.
"
225,"
April 20, 2017 at 6:24 MODERATE avalanche danger exists today due to lingering wind slabs and loose wet avalanche problems that will form as the sun comes out and the day warms up. This afternoon's sunshine and warming may also weaken the lingering wind slabs. Human-triggered avalanches large enough to cause problems for backcountry travelers are possible today. Wet slab avalanches should remain unlikely today, but they are not impossible. Avoid slopes where wet snow or wind slabs exist.
"
226,"
April 18, 2017 at 6:52 MODERATE avalanche danger continues at all elevations due to ongoing wind slab and loose wet avalanche problems. Human triggered avalanches are possible today. Natural avalanches are unlikely but not impossible in isolated areas. Identify and avoid areas of potential wind slab and loose wet avalanche problems. A small chance exists that a rapid warming situation could occur this afternoon.
"
227,"
April 17, 2017 at 6:47 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations due to a combination of wind slab and loose wet avalanche problems. Human triggered avalanches are possible today. Natural avalanches are unlikely but not impossible in isolated areas. Identify and avoid slopes where wind slab or loose wet avalanche problems may exist.
"
228,"
April 16, 2017 at 6:59 MODERATE avalanche danger continues today at all elevations. Uncertainly exists in regards to the degree of loose wet avalanche problems today as well as lingering wind slab avalanche problems. Conservative decision making and conservative terrain selection are advised.
"
229,"
April 15, 2017 at 7:00 The avalanche danger will increase to MODERATE today as sun and warmer temperatures cause more rapid warming. Human-triggered loose wet avalanches will be possible. Some natural loose wet avalanches may also be possible in a few areas. Human-triggered wind slab avalanches may remain possible in complex or extreme terrain or on wind-loaded slopes where rapid warming weakens wind slabs.
Avoid slopes where signs of warming or wet snow exist and slopes where wind slabs remain especially if they receive sunshine.   
"
230,"
April 13, 2017 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations today due to wind slabs on wind-loaded slopes and possible storm slabs in more sheltered terrain. Human-triggered avalanches are possible today. Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully to identify where avalanche problems may exist. Use this information to avoid areas with possible avalanche problems. If the storm ends earlier than forecasted and the sun comes out, rapid warming could accentuate these problems and also cause loose wet avalanche problems to form.
"
231,"
April 11, 2017 at 6:47 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger linger today above treeline due to the potential for yesterday's human triggered wind slab avalanche activity to continue. For near treeline and below treeline areas avalanche danger is LOW. Some areas with minor amounts of wet surface snow may exist today, but loose wet avalanche problems are not expected.
"
232,"
April 5, 2017 at 6:50 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger may exist this morning in locations that did not refreeze last night. In areas that did refreeze last night, MODERATE avalanche danger will develop at all elevations as daytime warming progresses. Loose wet avalanche problems are expected today at all elevations. Last night's snow surface refreeze is expected to have been relatively poor in the areas where it occurred.
"
233,"
April 1, 2017 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger will exist at all elevations today due to lingering wind slab problems and loose wet avalanche problems that form in response to daytime warming. Warming could also weaken the lingering wind slabs in some areas. The largest avalanche problems will exist in areas where more snow accumulated during the recent storm like the Mt. Rose area and other high-elevation areas across the region. Identify where wind slabs and loose wet avalanches may exist and avoid those areas.
"
234,"
March 23, 2017 at 6:58 MODERATE avalanche danger will exist on all aspects today due to rapid warming weakening the recent snow. Widespread loose wet avalanches will be likely today. The warming will also weaken existing slabs making human triggered wind and wet slab avalanches possible today as well.  Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully to identify where avalanche problems may exist and plan a route that avoids the potential avalanche problems. 
"
235,"
March 22, 2017 at 6:49 MODERATE avalanche danger at all elevations is expected today for the vast majority of the forecast area. Isolated, highly localized areas could have greater danger. Wind slab, loose wet, and storm slab avalanche problems are expected today. Identify suspect slopes and avoid areas of concern.
"
236,"
March 17, 2017 at 7:00 The avalanche danger will remain low for a brief period early this morning. As the day warms up, the avalanche danger will quickly rise to MODERATE as loose wet avalanches become possible. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and move to less steep slopes or slopes with colder more frozen snow once the snow becomes wet and unsupportable. Avoid slopes below large cornices and glide cracks. 
"
237,"
March 9, 2017 at 6:43 The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE today as loose wet avalanche become possible. Some of these loose wet avalanches may entrain enough snow to bury a person. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and move to colder shadier slopes once signs of loose wet instabilities like roller balls, pinwheels, or sinking deep into wet snow start to occur. 
"
238,"
March 8, 2017 at 6:43 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Loose wet avalanche problems will become increasingly widespread today. A wind slab avalanche problem may linger in isolated areas. Timing is important to avoid unstable wet snow as the loose wet problem will increase in response to daytime warming. Terrain with potential wind slabs will need evaluation on a slope by slope basis as signs of instability prior to an avalanche event will likely be very limited.
"
239,"
March 7, 2017 at 6:42 MODERATE avalanche danger today for all elevations due to lingering wind slab and developing loose wet avalanche problems. Evaluate terrain and conditions carefully, especially near and above treeline where the wind slab problem exists.
"
240,"
March 3, 2017 at 6:59 Loose wet avalanches will become possible at all elevations as the day warms up. The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE at all elevations today. Other lingering avalanche problems may also still exist like the large cornices above many slopes or instabilities on isolated terrain features in complex or extreme terrain. Identify terrain where avalanche problems may exist and use this information to plan a travel route that avoids the problematic terrain.
"
241,"
March 2, 2017 at 7:00 Loose wet avalanches will become possible at all elevations as the day warms up. The avalanche danger will rise to MODERATE at all elevations today. Identify terrain where avalanche problems may exist and use this information to plan a travel route that avoids the problematic terrain.
"
242,"
March 1, 2017 at 6:45 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger are expected today. Wet loose avalanche activity is possible at all elevations. Some small new wind slabs likely formed above treeline last night due to a shift to E winds. Identify areas of concern and communicate a terrain management plan with travel partners.
"
243,"
February 28, 2017 at 6:45 MODERATE avalanche danger will exist today at all elevations. Lingering wind slabs and developing wet loose avalanche problems are the concerns to manage today. Identify specific slopes of concern. Account for changing snowpack stability as daytime warming increases the likelihood of wet loose instability in sun exposed areas.
"
244,"
February 25, 2017 at 7:00 Human triggered wind slab avalanches and small loose snow sluffs will remain possible today. MODERATE avalanche danger exists in near and above treeline terrain today with LOW danger in below treeline areas. Carefully evaluate snowpack and terrain before committing to any slopes and identify where avalanche problems may exist. Use this information to avoid slopes where avalanche problems may exist.
"
245,"
February 24, 2017 at 6:59 MODERATE avalanche danger exists in near and above treeline terrain today with LOW danger in below treeline areas.

"
247,"
February 18, 2017 at 6:59 Some human-triggered wind slab avalanches may remain possible today. Near and above treeline MODERATE avalanche danger exists in wind-loaded areas. Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully to identify features where problematic wind slabs may exist and plan travel routes to avoid them.
"
248,"
February 17, 2017 at 6:59 Human-triggered wind slab avalanches will be possible today on wind-loaded slopes. Near and above treeline terrain will hold more widespread and larger wind slabs, but some wind slabs may still linger in below treeline terrain. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Due to unusual wind directions, wind slabs may exist in unusual places. Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully to identify where avalanche problems may exist and plan travel routes to avoid them.
"
249,"
February 16, 2017 at 6:59 Human-triggered wind slab avalanches will be possible today on wind-loaded slopes and some human-triggered storm slab avalanches may be possible on sheltered slopes. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. If more snow falls than forecasted, the avalanche danger could rise to CONSIDERABLE. Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully to identify where problematic storm slabs and wind slabs may exist and plan travel routes to avoid areas with these avalanche problems.
"
250,"
February 11, 2017 at 6:59 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on steep slopes at all elevations due to wind slabs formed during the storm and new wind slabs formed by the NE and E winds today. Human-triggered wind slab avalanches will remain possible today. Identify areas where wind slabs may exist and plan backcountry travel routes to avoid wind-loaded slopes.  
"
251,"
February 8, 2017 at 6:46 MODERATE avalanche danger exists for all elevations today. Wet loose and wind slab avalanche problems remain an ongoing concern. Precipitation intensity will be dramatically less today than yesterday and the snowpack has had time to establish drainage for rain on snow. Human triggered avalanches remain possible today. Natural avalanches are unlikely, but not impossible today in isolated areas. Exercise caution for travel in or below backcountry avalanche terrain.
	 
"
252,"
February 2, 2017 at 6:50 MODERATE avalanche danger is expected today for all elevations due to newly formed wind slab, storm slab, and possible wet loose avalanche problems. Avalanche activity is most likely to occur on slopes 35 degrees and steeper but could occur on lower angle slopes down to 30 degrees in some areas, especially below treeline. Increasing avalanche danger is expected late tonight into early Friday morning with CONSIDERABLE danger to possibly HIGH danger occurring overnight.
"
253,"
January 28, 2017 at 6:59 Human triggered wind slab avalanches may remain possible today due to wind slabs lingering in near and above treeline terrain. MODERATE avalanche danger exists on near and above treeline slopes. LOW avalanche danger exists in below treeline areas. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully before committing to a route. Use this information to identify features of concern like wind slabs and plan a route to avoid those areas of concern.
"
254,"
January 25, 2017 at 6:45 MODERATE avalanche danger exists in near treeline and above treeline areas on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to the possibility of another round of wind slab development. LOW avalanche danger exists for wind protected areas below treeline.
"
255,"
January 24, 2017 at 6:34 MODERATE avalanche danger exists near treeline and above treeline due to wind slabs. Below treeline LOW avalanche danger exists in wind protected areas. Areas of instability will exist within greater surrounding areas of seemingly good stability. This could create a false sense of security. Avoid relying on marginal islands of safety or grouping up in runout zones. Evaluate slopes and terrain carefully, especially when changing elevation bands or changing from one aspect to another.
"
256,"
January 14, 2017 at 6:54 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations due to newly formed wind slabs and unlikely but not impossible lingering deep slabs. Human triggered avalanches may remain possible today especially in regards to the wind slabs that formed yesterday. Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully before committing to any route and use this information to identify and avoid areas of concern. This data can also help find safer areas to recreate where good snow conditions exist.
"
257,"
January 2, 2017 at 7:00 Human triggered avalanches will be possible today at all elevations due to new wind slabs, new storm slabs, and lingering persistent slabs. Some avalanches could be large and have serious consequences. Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully; identify areas where instability may exist, and use this information to avoid those areas of concern. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. As more snow and wind impact the region this week, the avalanche danger will increase.
"
258,"
December 31, 2016 at 7:00 THIS ADVISORY WILL BE UPDATED ON JANUARY 2, 2017 at 7:00 am.
Human triggered avalanches will remain possible today and tomorrow on some slopes steeper than 32 degrees. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully; identify areas where instability may exist, and use this information to avoid those areas of concern. As more snow and wind imapct the region this week the avalanche danger will increase.
"
259,"
December 28, 2016 at 6:58 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger continue to exist at all elevations on slopes 32 degrees and steeper due to a combination of wind slabs and persistent slabs.

Exercise caution and conservative decision making during backcountry travel.
"
260,"
December 27, 2016 at 7:00 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist at all elevations on slopes 32 degrees and steeper due to a combination of wind slabs and persistent slabs. Several human triggered avalanches occurred yesterday with signs of persistent instability present in other areas. Human triggered avalanches are possible again today in a variety of areas. Isolated natural avalanche activity is unlikely but not impossible today. Exercise caution and conservative decision making during backcountry travel.
"
261,"
December 26, 2016 at 6:59 Some human triggered avalanches may remain possible on specific terrain today due to a combination of storm slabs in near and below treeline terrain and lingering wind slabs in wind-loaded near and above treeline terrain. MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations. Evaluate the snowpack and terrain carefully before committing to any slopes.
"
262,"
December 25, 2016 at 6:55 Human triggered avalanches remain possible at all elevations today due to a combination of storm slabs in near and below treeline terrain, wind slabs in wind-loaded near and above treeline terrain, and loose dry avalanches in non-wind-affected terrain.

"
263,"
December 20, 2016 at 6:50 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger linger near and above treeline due to old wind slabs. Below treeline, LOW avalanche danger exists. Avalanche activity has been reported in isolated areas each of the past two days.
"
264,"
December 19, 2016 at 7:10 MODERATE avalanche danger may exist due to possible wind slabs resting on a variety of weak layers on all wind-loaded aspects. Some of these wind slabs are small and some could be large. Human triggered wind slab avalanches may be possible today. A human triggered avalanche that may have been a wind slab was reported in the Mt. Rose backcountry yesterday. Triggering a deep slab avalanche on NW-N-NE aspects above 9000 ft. has become unlikely but not impossible. 
"
265,"
December 18, 2016 at 7:03 MODERATE avalanche danger may exist on NW-W-SW-S-SE aspects in above treeline terrain due to possible wind slabs created by forecasted NE and E winds. These new wind slabs should remain small but could knock a person off their feet. Triggering a deep slab avalanche on NW-N-NE aspects above 9000 ft. has become unlikely but not impossible. At elevations below 9000 ft. less avalanche danger exists, but firm icy slopes with a dusting of snow may exist on all aspects.
"
266,"
December 17, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists due to possible wind slabs on all aspects above treeline and on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects in near and below treeline terrain.

At elevations below 9000 ft. less avalanche danger exists, but firm icy slopes with a dusting of snow may exist on all aspects.
"
267,"
December 14, 2016 at 6:57 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist above 8,000' both above and below treeline on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to a combination of newly formed wind slabs above 8,000' and difficult to trigger persistent slabs above 9,000'. Below 8,000' to 9,000' firm icy surfaces exists in many areas and could pose dangerous travel conditions with long sliding falls possible.
"
268,"
December 13, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists due to possible persistent slabs on high elevation NW-N-NE aspects on slopes steeper than 32 degrees. While avalanches may have become harder to trigger, large destructive human-triggered avalanches may still be possible today. In addition to the avalanche danger, firm icy slopes may exist on all aspects up to 9000 ft. due to a frozen rain crust.
"
269,"
December 12, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists due to possible persistent slabs on high elevation NW-N-NE aspects on slopes steeper than 32 degrees and some unlikely but not impossible wind slabs on wind loaded upper elevation slopes. While avalanches may have become harder to trigger, large destructive human-triggered avalanches remain possible today. In addition to the avalanche danger, firm icy slopes may exist on all aspects up to 9000 ft. due to a frozen rain crust.
"
270,"
December 11, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists due to wind slabs on near and above treeline NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects steeper than 35 degrees and possible persistent slabs on high elevation N aspects and isolated NE aspects on slopes steeper than 32 degrees.

Dangerous avalanche conditions could exist today.
"
271,"
November 29, 2016 at 6:47 MODERATE avalanche danger exists near and above treeline on all aspects on slopes steeper than 35 degrees due to wind slabs formed by recent SW and NE winds. Persistent slabs are on ongoing problem on N aspects with MODERATE danger both above and below treeline on slopes steeper than 30 degrees in specific areas. LOW danger exists in most areas below treeline, with the exception of N aspects.
"
272,"
November 28, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on N aspects steeper than 30 degrees above 8300 ft. along the Sierra Crest and above 9300 ft. in the Mt. Rose area due to a persistent slab problem. MODERATE danger also exists on wind loaded near and above treeline slopes steeper than 35 degrees due to wind slab problems. Wind slabs may exist on any aspect due to the changing winds today. 
"
273,"
November 26, 2016 at 6:58 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on N aspects steeper than 30 degrees in all terrain above 8000 ft. due to possible persistent slabs. MODERATE avalanche danger also exists on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects in near and above treeline terrain on slopes steeper than 35 degrees due wind slabs. Large persistent slab avalanches are possible on true N aspects in the northern portion of the forecast area.
"
274,"
November 25, 2016 at 7:01 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on N aspects in all terrain above 8000 ft. and on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects in near and above treeline terrain on slopes steeper than 30 degrees due to a combination of wind slabs and persistent slabs. Large persistent slab avalanches are possible on true N aspects in the northern portion of the forecast area.
 
"
275,"
November 23, 2016 at 6:59 This is a two day advisory, valid now through Thanksgiving Day. Avalanche danger is MODERATE on all aspects at elevations above 7,000' on slopes 30 to 35 degrees and steeper due to a mix of wind slabs, persistent slabs, and storm slabs. Large persistent slab avalanches are possible on true N aspects in the northern portion of the forecast area.
"
276,"
April 14, 2016 at 7:10 MODERATE avalanche danger could exist on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects due to a combination of wind slabs in near and above treeline areas and loose dry avalanches. Today's avalanche activity should remain small due to the amount of new snow, but some avalanches could cause problems for backcountry travelers especially north of Tahoe City or near terrain traps. If the sun breaks through the clouds, today some small isolated loose wet avalanches could occur on the near and below treeline SE-S-SW aspects. 
"
277,"
April 12, 2016 at 6:58 Loose wet avalanches will remain possible all day today on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on all aspects and elevations. These loose wet avalanches will keep the avalanche danger at MODERATE for today.  Some of the loose wet avalanches could involve enough snow to threaten backcountry travelers. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Identify and avoid the areas where unsupportable deep wet snow exists. 
"
278,"
April 11, 2016 at 6:43 MODERATE avalanche danger continues for all elevations and aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to ongoing loose wet avalanche problems. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Identify and avoid steep terrain where unsupportable deep wet snow exists.

April 9, 2016 at 6:42 MODERATE avalanche danger continues for all aspects below 9,500' on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to ongoing loose wet avalanche problems. Little to no snow surface refreeze is expected to have occurred last night. The minimal amount of new snow that deposits over the highest elevations today is not expected to create new avalanche problems. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Identify and avoid the areas where wet snow depth is sufficient for loose wet avalanches to occur.
"
281,"
April 8, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE danger already exists on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on all aspects and elevations due to the presence of unfrozen loose wet snow. MODERATE danger will persist throughout the day as more loose wet snow forms resulting from daytime warming and rain impacting the area. Loose wet avalanches large enough to threaten backcountry travelers will be possible again today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Identify and avoid the areas where wet snow deep enough for loose wet avalanches exists.

282,"
April 7, 2016 at 7:01 MODERATE danger will quickly form on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on all aspects and elevations starting in the mid morning hours with the E-SE-S-SW aspects that receive morning sun. This warming should continue onto the W-NW-N-NE aspects during the day. Loose wet avalanches large enough to threaten backcountry travelers will be possible again today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Identify and avoid the areas where wet snow deep enough for loose wet avalanches exists. 
"
283,"
April 4, 2016 at 6:48 MODERATE avalanche danger will exist this morning and continue through the afternoon hours for all elevations and aspects on slope 35 degrees and steeper due to loose wet avalanche problems. Cloud cover last night is expected to have kept overnight snow surface refreeze from occurring in many areas. A period of LOW avalanche danger with supportable snow surface conditions may not exist this morning. A possible wet slab avalanche occurred yesterday in the Mount Rose area. Details are limited.
"
284,"
April 2, 2016 at 6:47 MODERATE avalanche danger will quickly form on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on E-SE-S-SW-W aspects at all elevations and may form on some sun-exposed near and below treeline NW-N-NE aspects as daytime warming makes loose wet avalanches possible again today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully. Identify and avoid the areas where wet snow deep enough for loose wet avalanches exists.

286,"
March 31, 2016 at 6:59 Loose wet avalanches will become possible today due to daytime warming. MODERATE avalanche danger will form on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on E-SE-S-SW-W aspects at all elevations and may form on some  below treeline NW-N-NE aspects.

March 26, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger will form on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on E-SE-S-SW-W aspects at all elevations and may form on some near and below treeline NW-N-NE aspects as loose wet avalanches become possible today. Some loose wet snow avalanches could entrain enough snow to pose a threat to backcountry travelers. Once deep wet snow exists on a slope, it is time to move to more frozen aspects, onto lower angle slopes, or to switch to a different afternoon activity.
"
288,"
March 24, 2016 at 6:53 MODERATE avalanche danger will form on sun-exposed E-SE-S-SW-W aspects steeper than 35 degrees at all elevations as loose wet avalanches become possible due to daytime warming today. Enough warming may also occur on the low elevation NW-N-NE aspects for some loose wet activity as well. Some loose wet snow avalanches could entrain enough snow to pose a threat to backcountry travelers today especially in areas where terrain traps exist. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully and identify features of concern. 
"
289,"
March 21, 2016 at 6:46 MODERATE avalanche danger continues for all elevations and aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper. Wind slabs are building in near treeline and above treeline areas on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects. Rain on snow is keeping the possibility of loose wet avalanche activity ongoing. Increasing avalanche danger will occur this evening through the overnight hours with CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger expected and HIGH avalanche danger possible. The likelihood of natural and human triggered slab avalanches will steadily increase today and tonight.
"
290,"
March 20, 2016 at 6:48 MODERATE avalanche danger exists today for all aspects both above and below treeline on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to expected poor snow surface refreeze last night and rain on snow this afternoon. Increasingly hazardous avalanche conditions are expected this evening into tomorrow as wind slabs begin to form in near and above treeline areas on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects.
"
291,"
March 19, 2016 at 6:55 Daytime warming will create enough wet snow on sun-exposed E-SE-S-SW-W aspects for MODERATE avalanche danger to develop on slopes steeper than 35 degrees at all elevations. Loose wet snow avalanches including roller balls, pinwheels, and point releases will be possible today. Most of these loose wet snow instabilities should remain small, but some of them could entrain enough snow to pose a threat to backcountry travelers especially those that occur around terrain traps.
"
292,"
March 18, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger will form on sun exposed E-SE-S-SW-W aspects steeper than 35 degrees at all elevations as daytime warming creates wet snow on these aspects. Loose wet snow avalanches including roller balls, pinwheels, and point releases will be possible today. While cornice failure has become unlikely, it is not impossible and today's warming could also weaken some of the large overhanging cornices that exist on the NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects along exposed ridgelines on isolated terrain features as well.

March 17, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger will form on sun exposed E-SE-S-SW-W aspects steeper than 35 degrees as wet snow forms on these aspects due to daytime warming. Loose wet snow avalanches including roller balls, pinwheels, and point releases will be possible today. This warming will also weaken the large overhanging cornices that exist on the NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects along exposed ridgelines making it possible for them to fail as well. 
"
294,"
March 12, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on near and above treeline NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects due newly formed wind slabs. Most wind slabs will exist along the Sierra Crest above 7500 ft. where more snow accumulated. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, and identify areas where avalanche problems exist. The avalanche danger will increase quickly as more snow and wind impact the region starting this evening with wind slabs and storm slabs becoming more problematic during the storm. 
"
295,"
March 11, 2016 at 7:01 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on all aspects due to the possibility of loose wet avalanches below 8500 ft. and wind slabs on near and above treeline W-NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects above 8500 ft.

March 10, 2016 at 6:59 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on slopes steeper than 35 degrees on all aspects due to the possibility of loose wet avalanches in near and below treeline terrain and wind slabs in near and above treeline terrain above 8500 ft. Some human triggered avalanches will be possible today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, and identify areas where avalanche problems might exist.
"
297,"
March 5, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on all aspects and elevations today due to newly formed wind slabs on wind loaded slopes above 8000 ft. and rain on snow creating loose wet snow instabilities on slopes below 8000 ft. Human triggered avalanches will be possible today.
Expect the avalanche danger to rise quickly as the next storm impacts the region tonight. Periods of HIGH avalanche danger may occur tonight as natural wind slab avalanches and storm slab avalanches become likely after midnight. 
"
298,"
February 20, 2016 at 6:53 MODERATE avalanche danger still exists on wind loaded near and above treeline NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects steeper than 35 degrees due to lingering wind slabs. Depending on the amount of daytime warming that occurs today, enough wet snow may form on the E-SE-S-SW-W aspects steeper than 35 degrees for the avalanche danger to rise to MODERATE on those slopes as well due to loose wet snow instabilities. Human triggered avalanches remain possible today.
"
299,"
February 4, 2016 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger may form on sun-exposed near and below treeline E-SE-S-SW-W aspects as well as on some above treeline SE-S-SW aspects due to the possibility of loose wet snow instabilities. Wet surface snow and small instabilities like pin wheels and roller balls can indicate that loose wet avalanches have become possible. The amount of warming that actually occurs today will dictate how widespread these possible wet snow instabilities may be. 
"
300,"
February 1, 2016 at 6:58 MODERATE avalanche danger exists for all elevations and all aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper. New wind slabs formed near treeline and above treeline last night under gale force NE wind conditions. In wind protected areas below treeline, loose dry avalanche activity remains likely and small storm slabs remain possible. Don't let an absence of obvious clues of instability lull your party into a sense of security today.

301,"
January 31, 2016 at 6:48 Upper end MODERATE avalanche danger exists today for all elevations and aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to a combination of newly formed wind slab, storm slab, and loose dry avalanche problems. Natural avalanche activity in not expected today, but isolated natural activity is certainly not out of the question. Human triggered avalanches are expected today and should not be a surprise to backcountry travelers.
"
302,"
January 25, 2016 at 6:56 MODERATE avalanche danger is expected today above treeline on SE-S-SW-W-NW aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper in areas where new wind slabs form this morning. For all other areas, LOW avalanche danger exists. Normal caution is advised. Very isolated deep persistent slab avalanches are unlikely but not impossible in open near treeline and below treeline areas on N-NE-E aspects on slopes 32 degrees and steeper.
"
303,"
January 24, 2016 at 6:59 Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger remain near and above treeline on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to recently formed wind slabs. Below treeline, there is LOW avalanche danger with pockets of MODERATE avalanche danger in open areas below treeline and near treeline on N-NE-E aspects on slopes 32 degrees and steeper due to deep persistent slabs.

January 22, 2016 at 6:57 Despite becoming increasingly difficult to trigger,  human triggered avalanches remain possible on some W-NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects at all elevations on slopes steeper than 32 degrees due to persistent slabs and old wind slabs. The avalanche danger is MODERATE today, but it will quickly increase to CONSIDERABLE due to added weight on the persistent slabs and new wind slabs resulting from more snow and wind impacting the region tonight and tomorrow. Some natural avalanche activity may start to occur during the night.
"
305,"
January 21, 2016 at 7:00 Even though avalanches have become more difficult to trigger, human triggered avalanches remain possible on some NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects at all elevations due to lingering persistent slabs and wind slabs. The persistent slabs could occur on slopes steeper than 32 degrees, while the wind slabs would be more problematic on slopes steeper than 35 degrees. The avalanche danger is MODERATE today, but the consequences of a human triggered avalanche would be serious. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify features of concern.
"
306,"
January 17, 2016 at 7:01 MODERATE avalanche danger continues at all elevations on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects on slopes 32 degrees and steeper due to a combination of persistent slabs and storm slabs. Human triggered avalanches remain a near daily occurrence within the forecast area. Identify the necessary differences between managing wind slab and persistent slab avalanche problems and adjust terrain selection and travel practices accordingly. Increasing avalanche danger is expected tonight into tomorrow morning.
"
307,"
January 16, 2016 at 7:11 On slopes steeper than 32 degrees, MODERATE avalanche danger exists on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects at all elevations due to lingering persistent slabs and wind slabs sitting on persistent weak layers. Large human triggered avalanches remain possible today. Unusual avalanche conditions exist. Avalanches on steeper slopes could be remotely triggered by a person standing in lower angle terrain or may be triggered in places traditionally considered safe. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully; identify features of concern.
"
308,"
January 11, 2016 at 6:57 Unusual avalanche conditions persist with pockets of MODERATE avalanche danger in open areas at and below treeline on N-NE-E-SE aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper.

"
316,"
December 19, 2015 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists at all elevations on NW-N-NE aspects and in near and above treeline terrain on E-SE aspects on slopes 32 degrees and steeper due to the combination of wind slabs and persistent slabs. Where persistent slabs exist avalanches could occur on lower angle slopes as shallow as 25 degrees. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully before committing to a slope. If more snow falls than forecast, the avalanche danger could increase. Human triggered avalanches are possible today.

December 14, 2015 at 6:56 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on slopes 32 degrees and steeper above treeline on all aspects, near treeline on NW-N-NE aspects, and below treeline NW-N-NE aspects. For other areas LOW avalanche danger exists. Today's avalanche problems are a combination of persistent slabs and wind slabs. Natural avalanches are unlikely today. Human triggered avalanches are possible and to a significant degree expected today near treeline and below treeline on NW-N-NE aspects where areas of buried surface hoar have not yet collapsed.

December 12, 2015 at 6:54 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on slopes steeper than 32 degrees on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects in near and above treeline terrain and on NW-N-NE aspects in below treeline terrain. Wind slabs will linger on wind loaded slopes, and the potential for persistent slabs still remains on some sheltered northerly aspects today. Evaluate snow and terrain carefully, and identify features of concern before committing to a slope. While avalanches will be more difficult to trigger today, human triggered avalanches will remain possible.
"
319,"
December 4, 2015 at 7:00 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects steeper than 35 degrees in near and above treeline terrain due to new wind slabs. Some isolated pockets of MODERATE danger may exist on NW-N-NE aspects steeper than 35 degrees at all elevations north of Emerald Bay due to storm slabs forming above a lingering persistent weak layer. Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully before committing to a slope instead of letting the excitement of early season snow lead to poor decision making.

321,"
November 26, 2015 at 6:51 MODERATE avalanche danger exists on all aspects and elevations on slopes 35 degrees and steeper. Wind slabs represent the primary avalanche concern on near and above treeline slopes with loose dry sluffs posing more of an issue in sheltered terrain. Human triggered avalanches remain possible today. Evaluate the snow and terrain carefully before committing to a slope instead of letting the excitement of early season snow lead to poor decision making. 
"
322,"
November 17, 2015 at 6:31 Pockets of MODERATE avalanche danger exist above treeline on all aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to lingering wind slabs. Near treeline and below treeline avalanche danger is LOW on all aspects. Isolated areas of unstable wind slab may remain near treeline, especially in complex terrain. LOW danger means that human triggered avalanches have become unlikely and areas of instability are isolated, not that avalanches will not occur.
	 
"
323,"
November 16, 2015 at 6:41 MODERATE avalanche danger exists today in the majority of areas on slopes 35 degrees and steeper. Wind slabs are a problem on all aspects in near and above treeline areas.

"
324,"
March 25, 2015 at 6:59Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger will form today on slopes 37 degrees and steeper in response to daytime warming. Widespread loose wet instability in the form of roller balls, pinwheels, and loose wet avalanches not large enough to bury or injure a person are expected. Areas of MODERATE danger will be most widespread NW-N-NE-E aspects where snow cover existed prior to the last storm and may form in very isolated areas on SE-S-SW-W aspects.
"
325,"
March 15, 2015 at 6:43Avalanche danger remains MODERATE for all elevations and aspects on slopes 37 degrees and steeper due to another suspected poor overnight snow surface refreeze and subsequent loose wet avalanche concerns.

"
328,"
March 1, 2015 at 7:00Areas of MODERATE avalanche danger exist on all aspects at all elevations on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to a combination of wind slab, persistent slab, and loose wet avalanche problems.

February 10, 2015 at 6:58Human triggered avalanches remain possible today. Above 8,000 ft, MODERATE avalanche danger exists on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to the presence of dense wind slabs and persistent slabs. If any avalanches do occur today, they could break above the person who triggers them and result involve a large amount of heavy dense snow that could easily bury or injure a person. Don't let the new snow lead to careless decision making.

331,"
February 9, 2015 at 6:55Human triggered avalanches remain possible today. Above 8,000 ft, MODERATE avalanche danger exists on all aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to the presence of dense wind slabs, storm slabs, and wet snow. If the dense slabs do break, they could break above the person who triggers them and result in avalanches large enough to bury a person. Don't let the new snow lead to careless decision making.

February 8, 2015 at 6:58Human triggered avalanches remain possible today. Above 8,000 ft, MODERATE avalanche danger exists on NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects on slopes 35 degrees and steeper due to lingering dense wind slabs and storm slabs. Some isolated areas of unstable storm slabs may linger on isolated terrain features on other aspects. Don't let the new snow lead to careless decision making. Specifically choosing slopes based on slope angle will be the difference between ""getting lucky"" and ""getting it done"" in the backcountry today.

December 6, 2014 at 7:00Above 9000 ft. in below, near, and above treeline terrain, human-triggered avalanches may remain possible on some NW-N-NE aspects due to persistent slabs on slopes 34 degrees and steeper. Pockets of MODERATE avalanche danger exist in these areas. Higher elevation northerly facing slopes with the most snow represent the most likely places to find persistent slabs and the places where people want to recreate. Don't let early season excitement overrule good judgment and decision making.
"
346,"
December 5, 2014 at 7:00Above 9000 ft. on slopes 32 degrees and steeper, human-triggered avalanches remain possible on NW-N-NE aspects due to possible persistent slabs. Near and above treeline wind-loaded NW-N-NE-E-SE aspects above 8000 ft. steeper than 35 degrees may still hold human-triggerable wind slabs especially on unsupported slopes, couliors and gullies, and in complex and/or extreme terrain. The avalanche danger rating for these areas remains MODERATE.
