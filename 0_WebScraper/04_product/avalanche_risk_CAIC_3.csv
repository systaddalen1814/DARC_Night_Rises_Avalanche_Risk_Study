1/15/2025,"You can easily trigger a large avalanche. Observers continue to report remote triggering large avalanches from a distance. Obvious signs of instability like cracking and collapsing are diminishing. The first warning you may get is the crack of an avalanche as you get enveloped in moving snow. Slopes with a lot of wind-drifted snow will produce the largest avalanches; the edges of pillows and steep rocky areas will be the easiest places to trigger an avalanche. With such tricky conditions, avoiding steep slopes is the only way to reduce your hazard.

The most dangerous slopes are north through southeast-facing slopes located directly below the ridgetop.The only way to avoid tangling with one of these large and destructive avalanches is to steer clear of steep slopes. Obvious signs of instability, such as shooting cracks and sounds of the snowpack collapsing, are decreasing. Don't mistake the absence of these warning signs for safer conditions.

1/12/2025,"You can trigger a deadly avalanche on many slopes. You might trigger a small slide in recently drifted snow, but the bigger hazard is slides that break deeply into the snowpack. Obvious signs that you can trigger a deep, dangerous slide, like booming, rumbling collapses, are diminishing. Yet observers continue to report large avalanches, many triggered remotely and some releasing naturally. Cracking only in drifted snow is a signal you can trigger a slide. Avoid steep slopes where you see this sign; small slides close to the surface can trigger larger, deeper avalanches. You can find safer travel on low-angled slopes well away from steep terrain.

1/8/2025,"You can trigger a deadly avalanche on most slopes. Many observers have reported triggering avalanches over 100 yards away on ridges or flat ground. You may not get any warning signs before triggering a very large avalanche. The most deadly slopes will be steep slopes where winds have drifted snow into thicker slabs, but the easiest slopes to trigger will be in shallow rocky terrain or areas that previously slid. This makes safe travel difficult, so give slopes steeper than 30 degrees a wide birth.
