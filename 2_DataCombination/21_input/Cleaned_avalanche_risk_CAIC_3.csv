1,15,2025,"you can easily trigger a large avalanche. observers continue to report remote triggering large avalanches from a distance. obvious signs of instability like cracking and collapsing are diminishing. the first warning you may get is the crack of an avalanche as you get enveloped in moving snow. slopes with a lot of wind-drifted snow will produce the largest avalanches; the edges of pillows and steep rocky areas will be the easiest places to trigger an avalanche. with such tricky conditions, avoiding steep slopes is the only way to reduce your hazard.",caic
1,14,2025,"Continued reports of collapsing sounds indicate the snowpack is still dangerous and you can trigger large avalanches. The most dangerous slopes are north through southeast-facing slopes located directly below the ridgetop.The only way to avoid tangling with one of these large and destructive avalanches is to steer clear of steep slopes. Obvious signs of instability, such as shooting cracks and sounds of the snowpack collapsing, are decreasing. Don't mistake the absence of these warning signs for safer conditions.

1,12,2025,"you can trigger a deadly avalanche on many slopes. you might trigger a small slide in recently drifted snow, but the bigger hazard is slides that break deeply into the snowpack. obvious signs that you can trigger a deep, dangerous slide, like booming, rumbling collapses, are diminishing. yet observers continue to report large avalanches, many triggered remotely and some releasing naturally. cracking only in drifted snow is a signal you can trigger a slide. avoid steep slopes where you see this sign; small slides close to the surface can trigger larger, deeper avalanches. you can find safer travel on low-angled slopes well away from steep terrain.",caic
1,11,2025,"avalanche conditions are dangerous; new snow and wind on saturday keep them that way. you can trigger a deadly avalanche on many slopes. you might trigger a small slide in recently drifted snow, but the bigger hazard is slides that break deeply into the snowpack. obvious signs that you can trigger a deep, dangerous slide, like booming, rumbling collapses, are diminishing. yet observers continue to report large avalanches, many triggered remotely and some releasing naturally. cracking just in drifted snow is a sign you can trigger a slide closer to the surface. avoid steep slopes where you see this sign; small slides close to the surface can trigger larger, deeper avalanches. you can find safer travel on low-angled slopes well away from steep terrain.",caic
1,10,2025,"avalanche conditions are dangerous; you can trigger a deadly avalanche on many slopes. obvious signs of unstable snow like cracking and collapsing are diminishing. yet observers continue to report large avalanches, many triggered remotely. with less feedback from the snow, it gets easier to talk yourself into steep terrain. don't let the first warning sign you see be a large slide with you under it. heavily drifted slopes are the most dangerous and are where you'll trigger the largest avalanches. you can find safer travel on low-angled slopes well away from steep terrain.",caic
1,9,2025,"avalanche conditions are very dangerous, and you can trigger a deadly avalanche on many slopes. obvious signs like cracking and collapsing are diminishing, yet observers report large avalanches, many triggered remotely daily. as warning signs reduce, it gets easier to talk yourself into steep terrain, but the first sign you may get is a large slide with you under it. slopes that have been heavily wind-drifted will be the most dangerous. you can find safer travel on low-angled slopes well away from steep terrain.",caic
1,8,2025,"you can trigger a deadly avalanche on most slopes. many observers have reported triggering avalanches over 100 yards away on ridges or flat ground. you may not get any warning signs before triggering a very large avalanche. the most deadly slopes will be steep slopes where winds have drifted snow into thicker slabs, but the easiest slopes to trigger will be in shallow rocky terrain or areas that previously slid. this makes safe travel difficult, so give slopes steeper than 30 degrees a wide birth.",caic

1,6,2025,"you can easily trigger an avalanche large enough to injure or kill you on many steep slopes. before triggering an avalanche, you may not see obvious signs of instability, like cracking or collapsing in the snow. you can trigger an avalanche from far away or in flat areas below steep slopes. although you can trigger avalanches in many places, wind-drifted steep slopes directly below ridgetop can produce the largest and deadliest avalanches. give these slopes a wide berth.",caic
1,5,2025,"A Special Avalanche Advisory is in effect from 4:30PM Friday to 5PM Sunday. Backcountry avalanche conditions are dangerous. You can easily trigger an avalanche large enough to injure or kill you on many steep slopes. You may not see obvious signs of instability, like cracking or collapsing in the snow, before triggering an avalanche. You can trigger an avalanche from far away or in flat areas below steep slopes. When dealing with remotely triggered avalanches, be aware of other parties nearby and steep slopes above you, even if you are in gentle or flat terrain. Safe backcountry travel this weekend means giving most slopes steeper than about 30 degrees a wide berth.On Saturday, a backcountry traveler on the ridge near Peak 1 remotely triggered a large, potentially deadly avalanche on the northeast face. These conditions are widespread throughout this zone. We haven't seen remote triggers like this in a long time.

1,3,2025,"avalanche conditions are dangerous. you can easily trigger avalanches large enough to bury or kill a person. some will grow very large and be nearly impossible to survive. in the past few days, backcountry travelers triggered many avalanches from a distance. avalanches can break wider and run farther than you expect. recreating in flat or low-angle terrain might not be enough to keep you safe if you're connected to steep slopes above. be aware of your surroundings and if there are other users below you. the best way to stay safe is to give most slopes steeper than about 30 degrees a wide buffer.",caic
12,31,2024,"a special avalanche advisory is in effect from 4:30 pm monday until 5 pm wednesday. avalanche conditions are dangerous. you can easily trigger avalanches large enough to injure or kill you. backcountry travelers triggered many avalanches from a distance or the bottom of steep slopes in the last few days. safe travel will require giving most slopes steeper than around 30 degrees wide buffers. be aware of steep terrain above you, even if you are in gentle or flat terrain. slopes where wind-drifting is occurring will be even more dangerous. this could occur in cross-loaded features, so avoid slopes below cornices and with obvious pillows of wind-drifted snow.",caic
12,29,2024,"An Avalanche Watch is in effect for the Summit County mountains and the Front Range. Very dangerous avalanche conditions develop overnight on Sunday, lasting through Monday. Strong winds and heavy snow will result in long-running natural avalanches and easy-to-trigger, large, dangerous avalanches. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended on Monday.On Sunday, backcountry travelers can easily trigger avalanches where the winds have drifted snow into thick slabs. Avalanches can also be triggered from the flats below steep slopes or adjacent low-angle slopes. Give wind-loaded slopes a wide berth. Slopes with recently wind-drifted snow are the most dangerous. Shooting cracks and audible collapses are obvious indications to avoid steep slopes.

12,28,2024,"backcountry travelers can  easily trigger avalanches on steep slopes. slopes with recently wind-drifted snow are the most dangerous. the strong winds may form drifts farther below ridgelines than you expect. they may be wrapped around terrain features in unusual ways. you will find drifted snow on some open slopes below treeline, too. drifts may be smooth, pillow-like, show textured scallops, or feel chalky and hard. shooting cracks and audible collapses are obvious indications to avoid steep slopes. choose wind-sheltered slopes or ones less than 30 degrees in steepness.",caic
12,27,2024,"you can easily trigger an avalanche on drifted slopes that face north through east to southeast at upper elevations. steep, drifted slopes below ridgelines are the most dangerous areas. you can recognize drifted slopes by their smooth, pillow-like appearance and fresh cornice development. if you trigger a slide in recently drifted snow it can easily step down and grow larger and more dangerous. if you notice obvious signs of instability like shooting cracks and audible collapses, then move to slopes sheltered from the wind or less than about 30 degrees.",caic
