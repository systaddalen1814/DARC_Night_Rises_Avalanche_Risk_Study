12,31,2024,"Avalanche activity has become unlikely for most of the forecast area. Still, triggering an avalanche may not be impossible on an isolated terrain feature in extreme terrain where wind-blown snow has piled up. Continue to use best-practice backcountry travel techniques, such as only exposing one person at a time to steep slopes and assessing the snow and terrain as you travel.
The next update to the avalanche forecast will occur on Jan 2, 2025 @ 7:00 am.",SAC
12,23,2024,"Today will be a break in storm activity with mild weather conditions.  Avalanches will remain unlikely, use normal caution if traveling in the backcountry today.  Avalanche danger is expected to increase tomorrow as a stronger storm enters our forecast region.",SAC
12,22,2024,"Light rain and high elevation snow is expected for our forecast area today.  These weather conditions should have limited change on avalanche activity.  Avalanches are unlikely, normal caution is advised if traveling in the backcountry today.",SAC
12,11,2024,"Avalanches remain unlikely today, but the avalanche danger will increase tonight and tomorrow as a storm hits the area.
Keep practicing good travel techniques, such as carrying avalanche safety gear, only exposing one person at a time when traveling in steep terrain, and regrouping in safe zones. Expect variable snow conditions and plenty of obstacles when traveling in the backcountry today.",SAC
12,10,2024,"Significant avalanche activity remains unlikely, but it is worth watching for isolated areas of wind-drifted snow that may have formed near ridges during the night.  Keep practicing good travel techniques like carrying avalanche safety gear, only exposing one person at a time when traveling in steep terrain, and regrouping in safe zones. Expect variable snow conditions and plenty of obstacles when traveling in the backcountry.",SAC
12,9,2024,LOW avalanche danger continues with avalanche activity unlikely.  Early season snowpack conditions prevail throughout the forecast region with a shallow snowpack and many obstacles present.  Use normal caution while traveling in the backcountry.,SAC
12,8,2024,Early season conditions exist with a shallow snowpack and variable snow surface conditions present.  Avalanche activity remains unlikely at this point.  Use normal caution if traveling in the backcountry today.,SAC
12,7,2024,"Avalanche activity remains unlikely at this time. Best practice, normal caution techniques for travel in backcountry avalanche terrain are advised.  Expect variable snow surface conditions and plenty of opportunities to encounter obstacles in the shallow snowpack.",SAC
12,6,2024,"Avalanche activity remains unlikely at this time. Best practice, normal caution techniques for travel in backcountry avalanche terrain are advised.  Expect variable snow surface conditions and plenty of opportunities to encounter obstacles in the shallow snowpack.",SAC
12,5,2024,"Avalanche activity remains unlikely at this time. Best practice, normal caution techniques for travel in backcountry avalanche terrain are advised.  Expect variable snow surface conditions and plenty of opportunities to encounter obstacles in the shallow snowpack.",SAC
12,4,2024,"Avalanche activity has grown unlikely, but people should still practice good travel techniques like carrying avalanche safety gear, only exposing one person at a time when traveling in steep terrain, and regrouping in safe zones. Expect variable snow conditions and plenty of obstacles when traveling in the backcountry. Talk with your group to make plans that match your skills with the current conditions.",SAC
12,3,2024,"Avalanche activity has grown unlikely, but some weak snow still lingers at the base of the snowpack on high-elevation, shady slopes. Talk with your group to make plans that match your skills with the current conditions. Carry avalanche safety gear, only expose one person at a time when traveling in steep terrain, and regroup in safe zones.",SAC
12,2,2024,"Mild sunny weather with light winds will continue.  A weak snowpack structure continues to be present in some isolated portions of the forecast region.  LOW avalanche danger exists with avalanches unlikely today, normal caution is advised.",SAC
12,1,2024,Snowpack coverage varies based on elevation and location.  Unstable snow and weak snowpack structure continue in isolated areas of the forecast region.  LOW avalanche danger exists with avalanches unlikely today.,SAC
11,30,2024,"There remains a small chance you might trigger an isolated, but sizable avalanche due to lingering poor snowpack structure. Not all LOW avalanche danger days are equal. Moving through avalanche terrain while acknowledging uncertainty and maintaining preparedness for a large and unexpected avalanche is the current theme.",SAC
