12,30,2024,"Gale force winds during yesterday's storm have created slabs of wind blown snow.  These slabs could remain reactive today in gully features, along ridges, and in open areas.  Use caution when traveling around these areas of concern.",SAC
12,28,2024,"You might still be able to trigger a large avalanche today above about 8,000' to 8,500'. The areas of greatest avalanche hazard exist near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes where wind-drifted snow was deposited Thursday-Thursday night. Move cautiously around slopes that are below cornices or wind drifts.",SAC
12,27,2024,"Triggering an avalanche remains possible today in a variety of areas. Above the rain/snow line, avalanche hazard is focused near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes where wind-drifted snow has deposited. Below the rain/snow line, wet snow avalanches remain possible in steep areas on any aspect.",SAC
12,26,2024,"Triggering an avalanche is possible today near ridgetops, in gullies, and on open slopes where wind-drifted snow has deposited. Slopes that hold locally deeper, wind-deposited snow have the greatest avalanche hazard today. Move around these areas with caution.",SAC
12,25,2024,"Triggering an avalanche remains possible near ridges, gullies, and open slopes where wind-blown snow has piled up. Loose sluffs of storm snow could also happen on steep slopes in wind-protected areas. Travel plans that skirt windy places and avoid terrain traps can help reduce your exposure to avalanches and their potential consequences.",SAC
12,21,2024,"Today's wind, light rain, and snow aren't expected to do much to change avalanche conditions. Triggering a large avalanche in an isolated area has become unlikely, but is certainly not impossible due to the current snowpack structure. Best practice backcountry travel techniques associated with normal caution are advised.",SAC
12,20,2024,There remains a low likelihood of triggering a large avalanche in isolated areas. Travel plans that select simple terrain combined with backcountry travel practices that use wide safety margins may help reduce the consequences of an unexpected avalanche involvement.,SAC
12,19,2024,"As evidenced by several large snowpack collapses triggered yesterday, triggering a large avalanche remains possible in isolated areas. If you see signs of unstable snow or have doubts about a slope, move on to a different option. Travel plans that select simple terrain combined with backcountry travel practices that use wide safety margins may help reduce the consequences of an avalanche accident.",SAC
12,18,2024,"Avalanche activity continues to decrease. However, triggering an avalanche may remain possible on an isolated steep slope where weak snow lurks below the storm snow or where wind-blown snow has piled up near ridges, gullies, and other exposed terrain. If you see signs of unstable snow or have doubts about a slope, move on to a different option. Travel plans that use simple terrain and create safety margins may help reduce the consequences of an avalanche.",SAC
12,17,2024,"People could still trigger large, dangerous avalanches today, especially in areas where weak snow lurks below the storm snow on steep slopes and where wind-blown snow has piled up near ridges, gullies, and other exposed terrain. Look for any potential signs of unstable snow like recent avalanches, cracking, collapsing, or even just feeling soft snow below more dense snow. Use travel plans that provide large safety buffers around any places where unstable snow might still exist.",SAC
11,29,2024,"In specific terrain, you still might trigger an isolated, but sizable avalanche due to lingering poor snowpack structure. Choose terrain intentionally, assessing the potential consequences of an unexpected avalanche. At this time, it remains wise to select terrain not capable of producing large avalanches.",SAC
11,28,2024,"You could trigger an avalanche today that is either a surface instability formed from blowing and drifting snow following a wind shift, or a deeper instability associated with weaker old snow at the bottom of the snowpack. Each require a different approach to terrain management. Intentional route planning and very specific terrain selection are recommended. This forecast was issued on Wednesday Nov 27. The next update will occur on Friday, Nov 29.",SAC

The next update to this forecast will occur on Friday, Nov 29.",SAC
11,25,2024,"An approaching storm will impact our forecast region starting today with heavy snow and strong winds.  In areas where weak snow continues to exist near the base of the snowpack, large avalanches remain possible as extra load gets added to these weak layers.  Strong winds will also create slabs of wind blown snow in open areas.  Avalanche danger is expected to quickly rise to CONSIDERABLE this evening, as the storm intensifies.",SAC
11,24,2024,The recent storm has deposited dense heavy snow on top of a weak and shallow snowpack.  Triggering large avalanches that could bury or injure a person remain possible today on many slopes.  Use caution if traveling near avalanche terrain where these avalanche problems exist.,SAC
11,22,2024,"You could trigger an avalanche large enough to bury a person today in certain areas, especially at and below treeline. This is where problematic old weak snow exists below the new snow. Conditions are highly variable around the forecast area with uneven distributions of new snow and rain.
A period of HIGH avalanche danger is expected tonight and may continue into tomorrow.",SAC
