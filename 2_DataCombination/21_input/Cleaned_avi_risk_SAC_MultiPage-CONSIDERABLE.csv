12,29,2024,"Another wet storm will enter our area with high elevation snow, rain, and strong winds.  Slabs of wind blown snow will form in gully features, below ridges, and in open terrain.  Sloughs of new snow could slide downhill on existing firm snow surfaces.  Dangerous avalanche conditions will exist today as more snow and wind impact our forecast region.",SAC
12,24,2024,"New snow and wind will make avalanches more likely today, especially near ridges, in gullies, and on windy slopes where wind-blown snow accumulates. Avalanches may also be possible on steep, sheltered slopes where the new snow piles up too fast. It will take constant effort to carefully reassess the snow and terrain as you travel in today's rapidly changing conditions.",SAC
12,16,2024,Many avalanches have occurred in the last 48 hours in our forecast region.  The recent storm snow overlies previous weak sugary surface snow that has led to large avalanches occurring.  Strong winds will continue to create slabs of wind blown snow in open areas.  Active loading of new snow and wind will occur today with avalanches remaining likely.,SAC
12,15,2024,A strong storm cycle deposited heavy dense snow with strong winds and left us with multiple avalanche problems.  This new storm snow now exists over previous weak surface snow.  Strong winds have created slabs of wind blown snow in exposed areas.  Dangerous avalanche conditions could exist today with large and destructive avalanches occurring.,SAC
12,13,2024,"There are numerous possibilities for avalanches today, both large and small. The areas of greatest avalanche danger exist in locations that received 8 or more inches of new snowfall over the past 24 hours. In some areas, this new snow was deposited on top of a weak old snow surface that could lead to complicated and dangerous avalanche problems. HIGH avalanche danger is expected for Saturday.",SAC
12,12,2024,A rapid increase in avalanche danger is expected this morning. The greatest avalanche danger will occur in areas that receive 6 or more inches of new snowfall today. This new snow is depositing on top of a weak old snow surface that could lead to complicated and dangerous avalanche problems.,SAC
11,26,2024,"Our current storm continues today with more heavy wet snow and strong winds.  In areas that have weak sugary snow near the base of the  snowpack, this heavy snow will add additional load with the potential for large avalanches.  Strong winds will continue to form slabs of wind blown snow in open areas.  Dangerous avalanche conditions could exist today.",SAC
11,23,2024,"A heavy load of rain and new snow was added to the snowpack last night. You could trigger an avalanche easily large enough to bury a person today in a variety of areas, including below treeline. Take a cautious approach to travel near avalanche terrain today, anticipating an increased likelihood of triggering an avalanche.",SAC
