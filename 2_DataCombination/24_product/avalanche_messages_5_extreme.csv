1,8,2017,"January 8, 2017 at 7:00 Natural and human triggered avalanches are certain today due to the significant amount of rain on snow expected below 9300 ft. and heavy wet snow loading above 9000 ft. Large, deep, destructive wet slab, deep slab, and wind slab avalanches will occur today as well as loose wet avalanches. Avalanches could run farther than expected and involve almost the entire snowpack. Avoid travel in or near avalanche terrain or runout zones today. EXTREME avalanche danger exists at all elevations.",sac

Today the avalanche danger is HIGH at mid and upper elevations. The danger may rise to EXTREME in some areas within the next day. The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE at low elevations. Avoid all avalanche terrain and avoid being under or near any steep slope. Even very small slopes can bury a person.
Heavy snowfall, strong westerly winds, and a weak faceted snowpack have created very dangerous avalanche conditions. Natural and human triggered avalanches are very likely. Even unusual avalanches are possible in atypical terrain on atypical aspects and elevations.  

Anybody going into or near the mountains today should avoid being near or under any steep slope - this includes skiing, snowshoeing, running, sledding, dog walking, etc.",Utah

Heavy snowfall and increasing winds have overloaded our weak faceted snow and created a HIGH avalanche danger. The danger may rise to EXTREME in some areas in the next day or two. Pay attention to changing weather - avalanche danger will increase as this storm intensifies. 
Natural and human triggered avalanches are very likely. Even unusual avalanches are possible in atypical terrain on atypical aspects and elevations.  



What to do? The only viable strategy today is to ride slopes less than 30 degrees in slope steepness, well out from under and not connected to slopes steeper than about 30 degrees.",Utah

Dangerous and destructive avalanches are likely on steep slopes at all elevations and on slopes facing all directions due to continuing mild temperatures, rain, heavy snow, strong southwest wind, and widespread preexisting weak snow.   Several large and long-running natural avalanches occurred in the past two days, and more persistent slab, wet, and wind slab avalanches are likely or ongoing today on steep slopes in the Logan Zone.
