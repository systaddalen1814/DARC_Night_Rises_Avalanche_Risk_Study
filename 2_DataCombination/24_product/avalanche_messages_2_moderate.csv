3,24,2016,"The danger of loose, wet snow avalanches is MODERATE today mainly on southerly aspects but it depends strongly on cloud cover. More clouds mean less danger, more sun means more danger. Wind slabs formed during strong NW winds Tuesday night/Wednesday morning will make the danger MODERATE on wind loaded slopes at mid and upper elevations. Generally safe conditions and a LOW danger exists on slopes sheltered from the sun and wind where the best snow can be found as well.",Utah

3,10,2016,"The avalanche danger is generally LOW early this morning, though wind drifts can still be triggered on upper elevation slopes facing north through southeast.  The avalanche danger will increase to MODERATE with heating today – wet loose sluffs will be easy to trigger, and natural slides are possible.  Avoid travel on and below steep sunny slopes once the snow heats up.",Utah
3,9,2016,The avalanche danger remains generally LOW in the majority of the backcountry terrain.  I hesitate to call it MODERATE on the steeper upper elevation ridgtop terrain but I suppose there may be minor human triggered avalanche activity.  Consider consequences of even a small slide if you are getting into the more unforgiving terrain.,Utah

Here, a cross-loaded wind drift would be the slab, sitting on a weak layer of faceted snow.  Elsewhere, the avalanche danger is LOW, with riding on lower angle, grassy slopes reducing the chance of hitting damaging rocks and stumps.",Utah
12,7,2017,"Weak, faceted layers of snow are lurking in the snowpack on northerly facing slopes. These layers have a slab of snow on top of them which is a recipe for an avalanche, but the most likely places to trigger an avalanche are places where yesterday's winds cross loaded slopes and deposited wind blown snow. For this reason the danger is MODERATE on upper elevation, northerly facing slopes and LOW elsewhere.",Utah
12,6,2017,"Layers of faceted snow lurk in the snowpack on northerly facing, upper elevation slopes. These layer and a fresh load of new snow from Monday make the danger MODERATE on these slopes. Faceted layers have been found on mid elevation slopes but they do not appear to be widespread. Watch for and avoid slopes with any recent wind loading which will increase the stress on buried faceted layers making avalanches easier to trigger.
Since coverage is thin and weak faceted layers plague the snowpack where it is deepest, play it safe and ride slopes less than 30 degrees in steepness. With limited terrain available for riding (low tide as some call it), take the time to practice with your rescue gear if you get out.",Utah

3,9,2016,The avalanche danger is generally LOW in the majority of the backcountry terrain.  I hesitate to call it MODERATE on the steeper upper elevation ridgtop terrain but I suppose there may be minor human triggered avalanche activity.  Consider consequences of even a small slide if you are getting into the more unforgiving terrain.,Utah
3,8,2016,"We have a mostly LOW danger this morning.  Within a few hours, the danger will rise to MODERATE with sun and daytime heating.  This includes all elevations and aspects but high north. Any wet sluffs triggered in the low to mid elevation sheltered aspects may gouge more deeply in the poorly consolidated snowpack, producing a larger debris pile.  
I would also avoid the repeater terrain along the Park City ridgeline and Mill Creek/Lambs canyons (No Name, Monitors, and Murdock Peak are good examples).  Remember that risk is always inherent in mountain travel and terrain choices may amplify the consequences of even a minor avalanche.",Utah
3,6,2016,"This morning the avalanche danger will be LOW but will rise to MODERATE when today's storm arrives. At low elevations rain may cause loose, wet snow avalanches. At mid and upper elevations, strong southerly winds and new snow will make wind slabs the main problem.",Utah

 As a general rule, please avoid being in the steep terrain of Superior through Lisa Falls when it's possible to trigger long running slides.",Utah
2,19,2016,"A MODERATE hazard for today with the primary concern being fresh wind drifts at mid and upper elevations. Although I am not expecting winds to be all that strong during the day today, any increase in winds may create fresh wind slabs, particularly at the  upper elevations. This will likely bump the hazard up a notch. Also be sure to watch for signs of wet loose avalanche activity as the day warms at all lower elevation aspects.
For those who simply don't want to mess in avalanche terrain today, stay on slopes less steep than 35 degrees and you will find safe, superb riding conditions.",Utah
2,18,2016,"The overall avalanche danger is MODERATE today. Loose, wet snow avalanches are possible at low elevations. At mid and high elevations, fresh wind slabs will create heightened avalanche conditions on wind loaded slopes.

2,16,2016,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on all steep slopes today.  The new snow has bonded poorly to mid and upper elevation slopes facing north and northeast, and a few lingering wind drifts could be triggered at the upper elevations.  Steep sunny slopes and all mid and lower elevation slopes have a MODERATE danger of wet loose sluffs as the day heats up.",Utah
2,14,2016,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  I do, however, expect we'll have areas of MODERATE danger for wind slabs in open, exposed terrain.  Cracking and collapsing are sure-fire indicators of localized instability.  If we see more snow than expected, loose dry sluffs will run with ease and abandon on the slick underlying crusts or recrystallized snow in the steepest terrain. 
Remember that your terrain choices magnify the overall risk.  They may also minimize the risk.  A small wind pocket on a test slope with a clean runout is quite different than that same small wind pocket above Sik-bird couloir or Trapdoor gulley.",Utah
2,12,2016,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW this morning. A MODERATE danger remains at high elevations due to the chance of a deep slab avalanche.

12,13,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep slopes facing north through north through easterly at the mid and upper elevations.  Old hard wind slabs hidden beneath the new snow are hard to identify, and could crack out under the weight of a person, sending you for a ride.  Shallow sluffs and new soft wind drifts can also be also triggered, especially on steep, shady slopes.",Utah
12,12,2014,"Avoid all slopes steeper than about 30 degrees with recent deposits of wind drifted snow.  They will look smooth and rounded and often sound hollow or feel ""slabby."" there is a MODERATE danger of human triggered avalanches on any slope with recent wind deposits.  You can find safer terrain on wind eroded slopes or all slopes less steep than 30 degrees including locally-connected terrain.",Utah
12,7,2014,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW, with pockets of MODERATE danger on upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through northeast. In isolated spots you could still trigger a slide breaking near the ground, and any ride in an early season avalanche will be rough, exposing you to rocks and stumps.",Utah
12,6,2014,"The avalanche danger is mostly LOW, with a MODERATE danger on upper elevation slopes above about 9,500’ facing northwest through north through northeast.  It may be possible to still trigger a slide on the upper elevation, shady slopes breaking near the ground.",Utah
12,5,2014,"Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  A MODERATE danger exists above about 9,500' on the slopes that face the north half of the compass.  Continue to evaluate the upper elevation terrain and snowpack carefully.",Utah
12,4,2014,Most terrain has a LOW avalanche danger.  A MODERATE danger exists in the highest northwest through east facing terrain where you may find some sensitive fresh wind drifts or the chance for triggering a persistent slab avalanche.  Continue to evaluate the upper elevation terrain and snowpack carefully.,Utah
12,3,2014,"An overall MODERATE danger exists in the backcountry for human triggered slides 1-3' deep and a couple hundred feet wide.  These Low-Probability/High-Consequence bone-snappers are found predominantly on west to north to east facing slopes above 9-9500'.  Cornice drops, previous tracks, and slope cuts tend to provide little to no information for these conditions.  These slides may also be triggered at a distance.  The danger associated with any new snow and wind may rise toward Moderate but will be generally harmless and short-lived.",Utah
12,2,2014,"A MODERATE danger exist in the northwest to north to northeast facing terrain above about 9500'.   We're trending toward a Low-Probability-High-Consequence regime where uncertainty remains high.  Uncertainty in my book = conservative decision making.
Probably the best and safest terrain would be mid elevation shady terrain no steeper than 30 degrees or so (with nothing steeper above).",Utah
11,30,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE in the Provo area mountains - you can still trigger a slide breaking to the ground. Avoid the steep, upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through northeast, the same aspects where 17 backcountry slides have been triggered in the Park City and Salt Lake mountains in just the past week. 
Choose gentle slopes, less steep than about 30 degrees, with nothing steep above.  Also avoid any fresh drifts of wind-blown snow.",Utah
11,29,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep,mid and upper elevation slopes facing northwest through north through east, where avalanches could still break to the ground.   If you are searching for the softer snow on these shady slopes, choose low angle terrain, with slopes gentler than about 30 degrees in steepness with nothing steep directly above you.  Also avoid any fresh drifts of wind-blown snow and steep slopes with punchy, damp snow.",Utah
11,16,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on northwest, north and northeasterly facing slopes above about 10,000’.  AVOID travel on and below these steep shady slopes if you are traveling to the higher elevations of the Provo area mountains.   There is also a MODERATE danger of triggering a wind drift on steep slopes of any aspect, at the upper elevations.
It is still a very shallow snowpack, and you could be injured by hitting rocks and stumps.  Also, none of the Utah mountain resorts are open for the season so you must treat the snow as a backcountry snowpack.",Utah
11,15,2014,"The avalanche danger is MODERATE on steep slopes above about 9,500’ or 10,000' facing northwest, north and northeast.  This is where fresh drifts of wind-blown snow are sitting of a weak base of sugary old snow.  If you get to these high elevation, it may be possible to trigger avalanches, which are large enough to take you for a ride.  The snow pack is so shallow; any ride will have you hitting rocks and stumps.  In addition, wind drifts on any steep slope should be avoided, including at the mid elevation where strong winds have also drifted the snow.  And remember, none of the mountain resorts are open for the season and you must treat the snow as a backcountry snowpack.",Utah
11,14,2014,"Although we have a LOW avalanche danger today, it will almost certainly rise to at least MODERATE Saturday through the weekend on steep slopes above about 9,500' that face northwest, north and northeast.
We'll update the avalanche forecast as the snow arrives and through the weekend.",Utah
12,26,2024,"You can trigger an avalanche on drifted slopes that face north through east to southeast. Steep, drifted slopes below ridgelines are the most dangerous areas. You can recognize drifted slopes by their smooth, pillow-like appearance. Avoid these areas and seek out wind-sheltered slopes as a safer option.You probably won't notice obvious signs of instability like shooting cracks and audible collapses until the storm intensifies. These signs are an indication that conditions are becoming more dangerous. Areas with more than about eight inches of new snow are more dangerous.

12,25,2024,"Light winds and a few inches of snow aren't enough to increase the danger. You can trigger an avalanche in drifted snow below steep ridgelines and convex rollovers. Look out for problematic drifts on alpine slopes that face northeast through east to southeast. Intense winds drifted snow into dense slabs on some slopes but completely scoured others. Right now, many of the most enticing places to ride are where you find problematic drifts. Hollow-sounding snow or cracking in the snow are signs to avoid steep slopes. Although, you probably won't see any warning signs before you trigger an avalanche.On shady and sheltered slopes at lower elevations, the snow is cohesionless and can sluff off of very steep slopes. These can be dangerous if you're above a gully or cliff.

12,20,2024,"you are most likely to trigger an avalanche on a northeast, east, or southeast-facing slope that was recently drifted. be careful on large, steep open slopes directly below ridgetop and consider sticking to more sheltered terrain. avalanches in drifted snow can grow large as they gouge into older snow layers.",caic
12,19,2024,"you can trigger an avalanche where intense winds built thick slabs of cohesive snow on top of a layer of weak snow one to two feet below the surface. upper-elevation east and southeast-facing slopes are the most dangerous but cross-loaded slopes that face north and northeast are also suspect. as slabs thicken and connect, you may be able to trigger an avalanche from a distance and below. slides can easily step down into weak snow closer to the ground and grow larger as well. look for and avoid pillows of firm snow in steep terrain, especially just below ridgelines. you can find safer riding on low-angle or wind-sheltered slopes.",caic
