### Avalanche Risk Communiaction Pipeline 

## 0_WebScraper 

This scapes the messages from our chosen avalanche centersâ€™ websites and
separates the files into CSVs by center, then again by risk. This way, each center has 5
associated files, one for each avalanche risk level. A data visualization was created for
each CSV to see where we had missing data.

## 1_DataClean

We will remove any rows with missing data for the messages. We
could generate a histogram or series of histograms to count the number of observations
from each site and at each risk level.
